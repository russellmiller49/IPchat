The consent informed all subjects that their final enrollment in the study would be determined after the bronchoscopy procedure for collateral ventilation assessment with the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System (510K Cleared K111764; Pulmonx Corporation).",
      "The sample size was estimated using the results from the VENT trial (U.S. and European cohorts) (11, 12). Based on the results of these studies, the responder rate (FEV1 improvement of >15%) in the Zephyr EBV treatment group was expected to be approximately 35% at 1 year. The responder rate for the control group was not expected to exceed 10% at 1 year. Assuming a two-sided 0.05 a level, study power of 90%, and 2:1 allocation random assignment, a sample size of 147 was expected to be adequate to test for superiority. The study sample size was increased to 183 to allow for 20% lost to follow-up and incomplete data. Each study site was allowed to enroll a maximum of 25 study participants.",
      "Eligible emphysema patients were ex-smokers between 40 and 75 years of age, with post-bronchodilator (BD) FEV1 between 15% and 45% predicted, TLC greater than 100% predicted, residual volume (RV) greater than or equal to 175% predicted, DLCO greater than or equal to 20% predicted, and a 6MWD between 100 and 500 m after a supervised pulmonary rehabilitation program (complete inclusion and exclusion criteria provided in Section E1 in the online supplement). Target lobe selection was based on a greater than 50% destruction score (percentage of voxels less than 2910 Hounsfield units on computed tomography [CT]) and heterogeneous emphysema defined as absolute difference of 15 or greater in destruction scores between the targeted and ipsilateral lobes determined by investigational sites using Myrian quantitative software (Intrasense; see Figure E1).",
      "Eligible patients were assessed with the Chartis to determine collateral ventilation status between targeted and adjacent lobes before randomization (19) (additional details provided in Section E2). Figure E2 shows examples of “collateral ventilation negative” and “collateral ventilation positive” assessments on Chartis. Subjects deemed to have a “collateral ventilation negative” target lobe by Chartis were randomized in a 2:1 fashion (blocked",
      "design) immediately after the Chartis assessment to either the EBV or standard-of-care (SoC) groups (see Section E3). The bronchoscopy procedure for subjects randomized to SoC was terminated after the Chartis assessment and subjects recovered per institutional clinical practice. Subjects randomized to EBV underwent placement of Zephyr EBV valves during the same session with the intent to achieve complete lobar occlusion (20). Subjects assessed as “collateral ventilation positive” were exited from the study (see Section E2 for complete details).",
      "Subjects randomized to SoC were discharged after post-bronchoscopy recovery. Subjects randomized to EBV were hospitalized for 5 nights regardless of clinical status and underwent daily chest radiographs (with the first taken within an hour of the bronchoscopy procedure) until discharge (see Figure E3 for postrandomization follow-up of study subjects). Frequency of chest radiographs for any hospitalization for an adverse event was at the discretion of the physician, but a chest radiograph was required on the day of discharge. Clinical staff was trained regarding the risk of a pneumothorax; equipment needed to treat a pneumothorax was kept bedside. At discharge, subjects were provided a wrist-band denoting “patient at risk of pneumothorax” and were instructed to seek immediate medical attention in the event of symptoms of a potential pneumothorax.",
      "EBV subjects were contacted daily by telephone for 10 days after discharge; and evaluated during site visits at Day 7, Day 30, and Day 45 after discharge. At 45 days, a high-resolution CT scan was performed and assessed by an Independent Core Lab (MedQIA) to determine target lobe volume reduction (TLVR), and to verify whether complete lobar occlusion had been achieved. If necessary (TLVR ,50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion), a repeat bronchoscopy and valve revision/replacement was recommended. All subjects had clinical visits at 45 days and 3, 6 , 9, and 12 months after bronchoscopy. To reduce variability in the collection of the spirometry data, all study sites used the ERT MasterScope (eResearch Technology), a central diagnostic station attached to a spirometer to capture the FEV1 and FVC measurements (see Section E4). EBV-treated subjects are planned for annual follow-up for an additional 4 years. After the 12-month",
      "evaluation, if eligible, SoC group subjects were given the option to crossover to EBV treatment with planned follow-up for an additional 5 years.",
      "Primary Outcome",
      "The primary endpoint was the percentage of subjects in the EBV group at 1 year after the procedure who had an improvement in the post-BD FEV1 of greater than or equal to 15% compared with the percentage of subjects achieving this improvement in the SoC group.",
      "Secondary Outcomes",
      "The secondary outcomes included difference between EBV and SoC groups in the absolute change at 1 year in FEV1, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ),and 6MWD.Additional effectiveness measures included TLVR at 45 days and 1 year after the procedure, RV, inspiratory capacity, TLC, FRC, DLCO, modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (mMRC), BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index, and for the EBV group only, the absolute and percent change in and the percentage of subjects achieving a TLVR minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of greater than or equal to 350 ml (19) relative to baseline.",
      "Safety was assessed in the treatment period (procedure through 45 d) and longer-term period (46 d through 1 yr) through review of all adverse events solicited at all scheduled or unscheduled visits. An independent Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated serious adverse events (SAEs), device-related events, and select respiratory adverse events. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board provided study oversight to ensure patient rights and safety were respected and maintained.",
      "Statistical Analyses",
      "All statistical analyses were performed using SAS versions 9.3 (SAS Institute). The rationale for the sample size is provided in Section E5. Descriptive statistics included means, SD, and 95% confidence intervals. Continuous variables were compared with an analysis of covariance with the respective baseline value as the covariate, and categorical variables were compared with the Fisher exact test, a chi-square test, or a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.

      "A median of four valves (range, 2–8) per subject were implanted in the 128 EBV subjects either under general anesthesia (64.8%) or conscious sedation (35.2%). Distribution of treated lobes was 66.4% left upper lobe, 11.7% left lower lobe, 10.9% right upper lobe, 6.3% right upper and right middle lobe combined, and 4.7% right lower lobe (see Table E6 for procedural details). Sixteen subjects (12.5%) with incomplete lobar occlusion and TLVR less than 50% verified through the high-resolution CT assessment at 45 days were eligible for valve adjustment; an additional two subjects were considered for valve adjustment by the investigator. Of these, 11 subjects underwent valve-adjustment procedures (see Table E7). A total of 35 subjects underwent 54 secondary procedures of which 11 procedures were for the protocol-allowed adjustment after verification of lobar occlusion, 28 procedures were for valve removals and/or subsequent valve replacement after an adverse event (adverse events requiring valve removal included 12 pneumothorax, two increased dyspnea, one respiratory failure, one hypoxemia, one subcutaneous emphysema, and one valve migration), 12 procedures were for clinical investigation (five for inspection of valves because of loss of atelectasis, three for lavage to clear mucus, four to investigate blood in sputum), and the remaining three procedures were for patient-requested valve removals for perceived lack of benefit. Eight subjects had all valves removed before to the 12-month evaluation.",
      "Outcomes",
      "Primary outcome. At 12 months after the procedure, 47.7% of the EBV subjects compared with 16.8% SoC subjects had a",
      "greater than or equal to 15% increase over baseline in post-BD FEV1, with a between-group absolute difference of 31.0 (95% confidence interval, 18.0–43.9%; P , 0.001; intention-to-treat). The results of the primary effectiveness endpoint are shown graphically in Figure 2.",
      "Secondary outcomes. All three secondary endpoints improved in favor of EBV and met statistical significance (Table 2 and Figure 3); the difference of means between EBV and SoC groups from baseline to 12 months for the absolute change in FEV1 was 0.106 L (17.96% for percent change in FEV1; P , 0.001) (Figure 3A), 6MWD was 39.3 m (P = 0.002) (Figure 3B), and SGRQ was 27.05 points (P = 0.004) (Figure 3C). Improvements in FEV1, 6MWD, and SGRQ score after EBV treatment were evident as early as 45 days after the procedure and persisted out to at least 12 months (Figure 4).",
      "There were two measures at baseline that were imbalanced between the EBV and SoC groups at a two-sided 0.10 level, mMRC (P = 0.091) and GOLD stage classification based on the percent predicted FEV1 (P = 0.037); however, there was no imbalance between groups based on FEV1. The interaction terms from logistic regression or from analysis of covariance with factors of treatment group and baseline value for mMRC or GOLD stage classification as covariate were not significant for the primary endpoint (P = 0.799 and P = 0.906 for mMRC and GOLD, respectively), or any of the secondary endpoints. Thus, neither of these variables had an impact on the primary or secondary effectiveness endpoints. The P value for the logistic regression with factors of treatment group, investigational site, and treatment group by investigational site interaction did not show any investigational site effect (P = 0.785).",
      "A significantly greater percentage of subjects in the EBV group than in the SoC group met or exceeded the MCID for FEV1 (change of >15% and >12%), SGRQ (change of <24 points), and 6MWD (change of >25 m), indicating meaningful clinical benefit was achieved (Figure 5; 6-mo responder data in Figure E4). Correspondingly, a higher percentage of subjects in the SoC group consistently either declined or had no change compared with the EBV group across these endpoints (Figure 6). Individual subject responses to each of these measures are presented graphically in Figure E5.",

      "Consistent with a durable TLVR at 12 months in the EBV group, there was a significant reduction in hyperinflation as measured by RV (decrease of 522 ml; P , 0.001; EBV – SoC) and RV/TLC ratio (decrease of 0.05; P , 0.001; EBV – SoC) (Table 2). At 12 months, RV decrease of 310 ml or more was achieved by 61.6% EBV subjects compared with 22.4% subjects in the SoC group (Figure 5). There was a significant improvement in gas exchange in the EBV compared with SoC groups (increase in DLCO of 0.870 ml CO/min/mm Hg; P = 0.013; EBV – SoC). The mMRC dyspnea score improved in favor of EBV with a between-group change of 20.8 points (P , 0.001) with a greater number of subjects in the EBV group (47.8%) than in the SOC group (18.6%) meeting or exceeding the MCID of 21 point change; P , 0.001).",

More subjects in the EBV than in the SoC group were responders achieving a MCID change of 21 point or less (58.0% vs. 24.1%, respectively; P , 0.001) (Figure 6). Supplemental oxygen usage at 12 months in the EBV and SoC group subjects was evaluated to compare change in oxygen usage from baseline.

      "Adverse Events",
      "A summary of all adverse events occurring at a frequency of 3% or more is provided in Table E12. Of the 501 EBVs that were implanted, two EBVs (in two subjects) were expectorated and three EBVs (in three subjects) migrated throughout the 12-month follow-up for a 0.4% expectoration rate and 0.6% migration rate. Investigator-reported respiratory SAEs listed in Table 3 show that significantly more subjects in the EBV group (35.2%) than in the SoC group (4.8%) experienced respiratory SAEs in the treatment period (day of procedure/randomization to 45 d) immediately after the bronchoscopy procedure (P , 0.001). This difference was primarily caused by a higher frequency of pneumothoraces in the EBV group during the treatment period, which were managed according to previously published and protocolized pneumothorax management algorithm (22) (see Figure E6). Select respiratory SAEs with onset after the most",
      "recent bronchoscopy procedure are summarized in Table E13.",
      "However, during the longer-term period (.46 d until 12-mo visit), the frequency of events was comparable between groups with 33.6% of the EBV group subjects and 30.6% of the SoC group subjects experiencing one or more respiratory SAEs. During the longer-term period (Table 3), there was a lower frequency of SAEs (COPD exacerbations, pneumonias, and respiratory failure) in the EBV group than in the SoC group (23.0% vs. 30.6%, 5.7% vs. 8.1%, and 0.8% vs. 3.2%, respectively), although none of these differences reached statistical significance. Over the 12-month follow-up, there were no episodes of hemoptysis (defined as .200 ml blood loss in ,24 h).",
      "Table 4 shows the rates of respiratory SAEs (i.e., annualized rates based on the time of occurrence). Investigator-reported event rates are compared with the CEC adjudicated event rates; CEC adjudication removed any investigator bias on nomenclature and attribution of adverse events by using standardized definitions. Based on the CEC adjudication, during the treatment period, only the pneumothorax rate was significantly different between groups with 0.275 events/45 days in the EBV group compared with no events in the SoC group (P , 0.001).

Eight of these events did not require any intervention (observation only). A total of 38 of the 46 pneumothoraces (83%) were managed with a placement of a chest tube; 12 of these events also required the removal of at least one valve. None of the pneumothoraces occurring in the longer-term period required the removal of any valves for their management. A total of 43 of the 46 pneumothoraces occurred within 13 days of a recent bronchoscopy procedure, of which 35 (76%) occurred within the first 3 days as shown in Figure 7, for a median event onset time of 1.0 day from a recent bronchoscopy procedure.",

      "pneumothorax-related deaths that occurred in subjects that were not treated in the most diseased lobe because of the heterogeneity requirement (difference in heterogeneity score of 15 between target and ipsilateral lobes) and the absence of collateral ventilation may imply that subjects with reduced capacity in the nontreated contralateral lung experience higher risk from the insult of single-lung ventilation during the pneumothorax event. Physicians performing EBV treatment must be trained on appropriate patient and lobe selection for treatment and anticipate and recognize a pneumothorax, which can be readily managed using standard approaches (22).",
      "The difference between groups for the change from baseline to 12 months of 39 m in the 6MWD is meaningful and demonstrates the persistent benefit EBV treatment provides in improving exercise tolerance in this patient group (27–29). The absolute mean change in 6MWD in the EBV group at 12 months compared with baseline was only 13 m. However, left untreated, the decline in 6MWD in patients with COPD at GOLD stage III/IV would be expected to be significant over time (30). As an example, in the NETT (National Emphysema Treatment Trial) study, untreated control patients in the non–high-risk group showed declines of 40 m in the",

Although there was a wide range of baseline 6MWD, there was no correlation between baseline 6MWD and key outcomes of FEV1, 6MWD, or SGRQ in contrast to NETT where substantial benefit was seen only in patients with low exercise tolerance (31). Although not powered to demonstrate this change, there was a reduction in the rate of respiratory failure events (P = 0.033) and a trend for a reduction in COPD exacerbations resulting in hospitalizations (P = 0.053) and in the longer-term period between EBV and SoC.

      "improvements resulting from a reduction in hyperinflation and improved lung function are consistent with similar findings after LVRS and warrant further study (32).",
      "Although prior randomized clinical trials of BLVR with Zephyr EBV treatment demonstrated improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, dyspnea, and quality of life compared with control subjects over a short-term period of 6 months, the LIBERATE study is the first trial to evaluate these outcomes compared with a control group over a longer period of at least 12 months while reinforcing the suitability of Zephyr EBV for both upper and lower lobe disease, and a wider range of baseline lung function (,20% compared with NETT) and baseline exercise tolerance. An additional important outcome in LIBERATE is the strong signal for the potential to reduce respiratory failure and COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization in the longer term, both being important goals of therapy for these patients. Taken together with the previous demonstration of its effectiveness in patients with both heterogeneous (14, 15, 17) and homogeneous (15, 16) emphysema selected for little to no collateral ventilation, unilateral EBV treatment now provides a",
      "viable treatment option for a group of patients with emphysema that is currently lacking. Unlike surgery or other bronchoscopic interventions (33–36) EBVs are readily removable, allowing the procedure to be reversed if a patient does not respond or has complications.",
      "The 27% frequency of pneumothorax SAEs in the treatment period is consistent with previous studies (16, 17) and the occurrence of pneumothorax does not seem to negatively impact clinical outcomes as seen in this study and previously reported by Gompelmann and coworkers (26) and Kemp and coworkers (17). Seventy-six percent of the pneumothoraces occurred within 3 days after the most recent bronchoscopy (index procedure for those who did not have a secondary bronchoscopy), and 85% were within 5 days after the most recent bronchoscopy procedure. These statistics support a minimum 3-day hospital stay after EBV procedure to ensure timely management of a pneumothorax if it occurs. As in previous studies, the specific algorithm for managing pneumothorax after EBV procedures developed by experts (22) was used to manage this consequence of the procedure during the present study and highlights the need for physicians performing",
      "this procedure to have expertise in the management of procedural complications. One pneumothorax-related death at 13 days post-EBV procedure underlines the need to provide patients with clear instructions on recognizing symptoms of a pneumothorax and to seek emergent help if experiencing these symptoms.",
      "The study has certain limitations. First, although many subjects did not meet the very strict inclusion/exclusion criteria that included baseline lung function measures, prior medical history, and so forth, 40% (280/706) of the screen failures were related to destruction score and heterogeneity requirements, the thresholds for which were arbitrarily chosen at the time the study was designed. Subsequent experience with homogenous patients in other trials (15, 16) has established the applicability of this therapy to a broader population. Similarly, the inclusion of subjects with little or no collateral ventilationwas limitedto their assessment with Chartis, which uses physiologic measures of airflow and airway resistance for assessing collateral ventilation status. The more recent evolution of novel quantitative CT (QCT) techniques now enables the noninvasive screening of subjects for collateral ventilation, with immediate exclusion of subjects with less than 80% complete fissure on QCT, Chartis requirement only in subjects with greater than 80% to less than 95% complete fissure on QCT, and treatment with EBV of subjects with greater than 95% complete fissure on QCT without Chartis (37, 38). This approach could have streamlined the screening out of subjects with completely absent fissures and perhaps reduced some screening bronchoscopies in this study.",
      "A second limitation of the study was allowing a repeat bronchoscopy for valve revision/replacement only in subjects with TLVR less than 50%, and incomplete lobar occlusion based on the 45-day CT assessment by the Imaging Core Lab. These dual criteria were too restrictive and prevented many subjects from potentially benefitting from a revision procedure. In clinical practice (20), repeat bronchoscopies for valve revision are performed based on clinical judgment if a patient has a lack of clinical response or experiences a sudden late loss of benefit.",
      "The observed benefit to risk profile of EBV treatment must be assessed considering the limited treatment options for patients",
      "with severe emphysema. LIBERATE shows improvements over nontreated control subjects at the same magnitude as those seen after LVRS (EBV vs. LVRS: FEV1 [29], 17% vs. 19%; 6MWD [5], 39.3 vs. 44.7 m; SGRQ score [9], 27.05 vs. 213.9 points). However, Zephyr EBV treatment has less morbidity than LVRS: pneumothorax requiring chest tube (EBV vs. LVRS: ,30% vs. .90%), respiratory failure (EBV vs. LVRS: ,30% vs. .90%), and pneumonia (EBV vs. LVRS: 4% vs. 18%). Specifically, 90-day mortality after EBV is lower than LVRS with a rate of 3.1% compared with 5.0% in the LVRS non-high-risk group (39). Although the risks associated with LVRS are considered acceptable, this approach remains relatively underused (40). The only other remaining alternative of lung transplantation has a limitation of strict patient eligibility superimposed over the limited availability of donor lungs (41).",
      "Conclusions",
      "Zephyr EBV treatment in carefully selected patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe provides clinically meaningful and statistically significant benefits in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life over current SoC medical therapy out to at least 12 months. The benefits are comparable with those seen with LVRS but with a reduction in post-procedure morbidity. BLVR with the Zephyr EBV provides a viable treatment option for patients with severe emphysema and hyperinflation. n",

      "Methods: Subjects were enrolled with a 2:1 randomization (EBV/standard of care [SoC]) at 24 sites. Primary outcome at 12 months was the DEBV–SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from baseline of greater than or equal to 15%. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in post-bronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute-walk distance, and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire scores."

      "Measurements and Main Results: A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects had a DFEV1 greater than or equal to 15% (P ,",

DEBV–SoC at 12 months was statistically and clinically significant: for FEV1, 0.106 L (P , 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance, 139.31 m (P = 0.002); and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, 27.05 points (P = 0.004). Significant DEBV–SoC were also observed in hyperinflation (residual volume, 2522 ml; P , 0.001), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (20.8 points; P , 0.001), and the BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index (21.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 d), in 34/128 (26.6%) of EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during this phase, and one each in the EBV and SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months."

      "Scientific Knowledge on the Subject: Patients with severe heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation selected for little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral lobe benefitfrom Zephyr Endobronchial Valve treatment with significant clinical improvements over standard of care medical management in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life out to 6 months.",
      "What This Study Adds to the Field: This multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of the Zephyr Endobronchial Valve treatment in patients with heterogeneous emphysema distribution and little to no collateral ventilation demonstrates significant clinically meaningful benefits over current standard of care medical therapy in lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity, and quality of life out to at least 12 months after the procedure.",
      "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the third leading cause of mortality in the United States with 15.4 million physician visits, 1.5 million emergency department visits, and 726,000 hospitalizations each year (1). Patients with advanced emphysema, one of the diseases that comprises COPD, are characterized by hyperinflation that precipitates breathlessness and predisposes",
      "individuals to exacerbations and has a greater negative impact on health status than self-reported cardiovascular disease and diabetes (2, 3).",
      "Many surgical procedures have been devised to treat this disease including costochondrectomy, phrenic crush, pneumoperitoneum, pleural abrasion, surgical lung denervation, and thoracoplasty. But apart from lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS), bullectomy, and lung transplantation all others have not proven to be viable (4). LVRS has been extensively studied, and in appropriately selected patients reduces hyperinflation improving lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and long-term survival (5–7). However, LVRS is underused because of concerns about the invasiveness of the procedure, increased associated perioperative morbidity and mortality, and narrow patient eligibility criteria (8–10). Zephyr Endobronchial Valves (Zephyr EBV, Pulmonx Corporation) are small duckbill valves inserted bronchoscopically into the lung to occlude an emphysematous lobe. Lobar deflation from the EBV leads to partial or full lobar atelectasis, thus reducing hyperinflation and mimicking the mechanisms of LVRS.",
      "In the first randomized controlled trial of Zephyr EBV, VENT (Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial), the coprimary endpoints of FEV1 and 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD) achieved statistical but not clinically meaningful improvements between groups (11). Post hoc analysis showed that only patients with complete fissures in the treated lung and in whom lobar occlusion (occlusive positioning of valves in all segmental and subsegmental airways feeding the",
      "target lobe) was achieved had clinically meaningful outcomes (12, 13).",
      "After VENT, subsequent short-term studies with Zephyr EBV have shown that by selecting patients with little to no collateral ventilation between target and ipsilateral lobes and performing post-procedure confirmation of lobar occlusion, similar benefits to LVRS can be achieved in patients with heterogeneous or homogeneous emphysema (14–17) but with less morbidity. All these studies included a control arm and followed subjects out to 3 or 6 months.",
      "LIBERATE (Pulmonx Endobronchial Valves Used in Treatment of Emphysema) is the first large randomized controlled multicenter international study conducted in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and with little to no collateral ventilation in the target lung to evaluate the effectiveness, safety, and durability of benefit out to 12 months. The study compared Zephyr EBV treatment with standard medical management to standard medical management alone."
