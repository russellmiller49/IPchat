      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The optimal initial treatment approach for pneumothorax remains controversial. This systemic review and meta-analysis investigated the effectiveness of small-bore pigtail catheter (PC) drainage compared with that of large-bore chest tube (LBCT) drainage as the initial treatment approach for all subtypes of pneumothorax. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were systematically searched for observational studies and randomized controlled trials published up to October 9, 2017, that compared PC and LBCT as the initial treatment for pneumothorax. The investigative outcomes included success rates, recurrence rates, complication rates, drainage duration, and hospital stay. RESULTS: Of the 11 included studies (875 patients), the success rate was similar in the PC (79.84%) and LBCT (82.87%) groups, with a risk ratio of 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93 to 1.05; I2 = 0%). Specifically, PC drainage was associated with a significantly lower complication rate following spontaneous pneumothorax than LBCT drainage (Peto odds ratio: 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28 to 0.85]; I2 = 29%). In the spontaneous subgroup, PC drainage was associated with a significantly shorter drainage duration (mean difference, -1.51 [95% CI, -2.93 to -0.09]) and hospital stay (mean difference: -2.54 [95% CI, -3.16 to -1.92]; P < .001) than the LBCT group. CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results of the meta-analysis suggest PC drainage may be considered as the initial treatment option for patients with primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax. Ideally, randomized controlled trials are needed to compare PC vs LBCT among different subgroups of patients with pneumothorax, which may ultimately improve clinical care and management for these patients.",
      "methods": "We systematically searched PubMed and Embase for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies published up to October 9, 2017. Natural language terms, Emtree and MeSH terms were combined to identify studies comparing pigtail catheter (PC) vs large-bore chest tube (LBCT) as initial treatment for pneumothorax. Inclusion criteria: RCTs or cohort studies reporting success, recurrence, complications, drainage duration, or hospital stay for primary/secondary spontaneous, traumatic, or iatrogenic pneumothorax. Exclusions: newborn populations; studies reporting only PC or only LBCT. Study quality was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (RCTs) and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (cohorts). Random-effects models were used; RR and Peto OR for categorical outcomes, MD for continuous outcomes; heterogeneity by I2; two-sided alpha 0.05.",
      "results": "Eleven studies (2 RCTs, 9 retrospective cohorts) with 875 patients from the United States, Egypt, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Denmark were included. Overall success: PC 293/367 (79.84%) vs LBCT 421/508 (82.87%); RR 0.99 (95% CI, 0.93-1.05; I2 = 0%). Traumatic subgroup: PC 86/95 vs LBCT 158/166; RR 0.97 (95% CI, 0.86-1.08; I2 = 35%). Spontaneous subgroup: PC 170/229 vs LBCT 244/320; RR 1.06 (95% CI, 0.95-1.18; I2 = 0%). Recurrence (spontaneous, 4 studies): PC 33/157 (21.02%) vs LBCT 43/143 (30.07%); RR 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57-1.09; I2 = 0%). Complications (overall, 9 studies): PC 32/278 (11.51%) vs LBCT 72/436 (16.51%); Peto OR 0.63 (95% CI, 0.39-1.03; I2 = 26%). In spontaneous pneumothorax, complications were lower with PC (Peto OR 0.49 [95% CI, 0.28-0.85]; I2 = 29%). Drainage duration favored PC overall (MD -1.03 days [95% CI, -1.84 to -0.23]; I2 = 51%) and in spontaneous subgroup (MD -1.51 days [95% CI, -2.93 to -0.09]). Hospital stay favored PC in spontaneous subgroup (MD -2.54 days [95% CI, -3.16 to -1.92]; P < .001)."
