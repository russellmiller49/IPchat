      "abstract": "Objective: To compare endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) with mediastinoscopy for mediastinal lymph node staging of potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: Patients with confirmed or suspected non-small cell lung cancer who required mediastinoscopy to determine suitability for lung cancer resection were entered into the trial. All patients underwent EBUS-TBNA followed by mediastinoscopy under general anesthesia. If both were negative for N2 or N3 disease, the patient underwent pulmonary resection and mediastinal lymphadenectomy. Results: Between July 2006 and August 2010, 190 patients were registered, 159 enrolled, and 153 were eligible for analysis. EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy sampled an average of 3 and 4 lymph node stations per patient, respectively. The mean short axis of the lymph node biopsied by EBUS-TBNA was 6.9 (SD 2.9) mm. The prevalence of N2/N3 disease was 35% (53/153). There was excellent agreement between EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy for mediastinal staging in 136 patients (91%; Kappa 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-0.9). Specificity and positive predictive value for both techniques were 100%. Sensitivity, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy for EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy were 81%, 91%, 93%, and 79%, 90%, 93%, respectively. No significant differences were found by McNemar’s test (P = .78). There were no complications from EBUS-TBNA. Minor complications from mediastinoscopy occurred in 4/153 (2.6%). Conclusions: EBUS-TBNA and mediastinoscopy achieved similar results for mediastinal staging. As performed, EBUS-TBNA can replace mediastinoscopy in potentially resectable non-small cell lung cancer.",
      "methods": "Prospective, controlled, paired diagnostic accuracy study at a single academic center. Adults with confirmed or suspected NSCLC requiring mediastinoscopy for mediastinal staging underwent EBUS-TBNA first under general anesthesia, followed by standard cervical mediastinoscopy in the same session. The surgeon performing mediastinoscopy was blinded to EBUS-TBNA cytology results. If both procedures showed no N2/N3 disease, patients proceeded to pulmonary resection with systematic mediastinal lymphadenectomy; surgical pathology served as reference where applicable. EBUS-TBNA was performed using a convex probe EBUS bronchoscope with a 22-gauge needle, targeting contralateral nodes first; ROSE was used to assess adequacy, up to 5 passes per node. Mediastinoscopy sampled stations 2R, 4R, 2L, 4L, and 7. Adequate sampling required diagnostic material or lymphoid tissue. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy were calculated; agreement assessed with Cohen’s kappa; paired comparison of correct/incorrect staging by McNemar’s test.",
      "results": "Of 190 registered, 159 enrolled; 153 were eligible and analyzed. Mean age 66.8 years; 55% male. Most had cN0/1 on imaging (64%). EBUS-TBNA mean procedure time was 20.2 minutes. EBUS-TBNA sampled 426 lymph nodes (≈3 per patient); mediastinoscopy sampled 573 (≈4 per patient). EBUS-TBNA had 8 false-negative lymph node stations and 122 inadequately sampled stations (predominantly <5 mm); mediastinoscopy had 14 false-negative stations and 10 inadequate samples. N2/N3 prevalence was 53/153 (35%). Specificity and PPV were 100% for both tests. EBUS-TBNA: sensitivity 81%, NPV 91%, accuracy 93% (TP 43, FN 10, TN 100, FP 0). Mediastinoscopy: sensitivity 79%, NPV 90%, accuracy 93% (TP 42, FN 11, TN 100, FP 0). Agreement was excellent (kappa 0.8; 95% CI 0.7-0.9). McNemar’s test showed no significant difference (P = .78). Both tests were incorrect in 4 patients (one 4R, three stations 5/6 beyond both tests). Mediastinoscopy missed 7 cases detected by EBUS (N2 5, N3 2); EBUS missed 6 cases detected by mediastinoscopy (N2 5, N3 1), including two stations not sampled (2R) and four micrometastases. No EBUS-TBNA complications; mediastinoscopy had 4 minor complications (2 hematomas, 1 left recurrent nerve injury, 1 wound infection)."
