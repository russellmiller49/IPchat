      "abstract": "PURPOSE: Obstructive symptoms that affect quality of life (QOL) are commonly caused by endobronchial disease in many patients with locally advanced, inoperable lung cancer. High-dose-rate endobronchial brachytherapy (HDREBBT) has been used to palliate these symptoms, yet its role is not well defined in the literature. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Ninety-eight patients with locally advanced, inoperable lung cancer received HDREBBT. They were prospectively followed for survival, QOL, and toxicity endpoints. QOL measures were captured using the Quality of Life Questionnaire-Lung Cancer 30 and -Lung Cancer 13. RESULTS: At 1-year follow-up, no significant toxicities were seen. Overall survival was 13.4% at 12 months (mean 192 days). Performance status, additional treatment after HDREBBT and treatment intent affected overall survival on univariate analysis (p < 0.05). Mean hemoptysis-free survival for all patients was 232.3 days, cough-free survival was 140.3 days, and dyspnea-free survival was 173.5 days. There was no impact of any treatment- or patient-related factors of these outcomes on multivariate analysis, including additional treatment modalities and HDREBBT dose. CONCLUSIONS: HDREBBT is a safe and effective way to palliate endobronchial symptoms. Additional external-beam radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or chemoradiation after HDREBBT improves survival, but does not affect QOL measures.",
      "methods": "Inoperable patients with endobronchial disease on bronchoscopy or imaging and obstructive symptoms were eligible. Patients were followed every 3 months for at least 1 year. QOL was assessed using EORTC QLQ-LC30 and QLQ-LC13. HDREBBT was delivered using flexible bronchoscopy with plastic catheters placed adjacent to/beyond the tumor. A usual dose of 7 Gy (range 5-10 Gy) per fraction was prescribed to 1 cm from source axis for mainstem bronchus tumors or 0.5 cm for segmental bronchi. Fractionation ranged 1-4 fractions, typically weekly. Treatment planning used BrachyVision; delivery via Varian VariSource Ir-192. EBRT/chemotherapy were not given concurrently; a 2-week break was used between modalities. Survival was defined from first consultation to death; symptom-free survival from first brachytherapy insertion to symptom return/progression. Kaplan-Meier and log-rank tests were used; Cox proportional hazards models for uni- and multivariable analyses. SAS software was used. Ethics approval obtained.",
      "results": "Ninety-eight patients (mean age 69 years) were treated; 78% newly diagnosed, 22% recurrent. Treatments on study: HDREBBT alone 52, HDREBBT+EBRT 34, HDREBBT+CRT 6, HDREBBT+chemotherapy 6. Overall survival at 12 months was 13.4%, mean survival 192 days. On multivariable Cox analysis: higher performance status (p = 0.04; HR 0.831, 95% CI 0.696-0.992), absence of cardiac comorbidities (p = 0.0008; HR 0.379, 95% CI 0.216-0.668), and tumor site (right vs left) (p = 0.0056; HR 1.673, 95% CI 1.16-2.41) were associated with differences in OS. On univariable analysis, higher performance status (p = 0.002), additional treatment after HDREBBT (p = 0.027), and treatment intent (radical vs palliative) (p = 0.0153) were significant. Mean hemoptysis-free survival was 232.3 days, cough-free 140.3 days, and dyspnea-free 173.5 days overall; no treatment- or patient-related factors impacted these outcomes (p > 0.05). Symptom-free survival by treatment (days): Hemoptysis—HDREBBT alone 132.26, HDREBBT+EBRT 57.23, HDREBBT+chemotherapy 225, HDREBBT+CRT not reported; Cough—HDREBBT alone 159.38, HDREBBT+EBRT 99.66, HDREBBT+chemotherapy 80, HDREBBT+CRT 120; Dyspnea—HDREBBT alone 122.43, HDREBBT+EBRT 171.63, HDREBBT+chemotherapy 114, HDREBBT+CRT 120. No significant toxicities were observed at 1 year."
