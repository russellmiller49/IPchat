      "abstract": "Background: The use of 22- or 21-gauge (G) endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) needles is recommended for lung cancer diagnosis and staging. Increasing demand for tissue for molecular workup and PD-L1 staining prompted comparison of a larger 19-G EBUS needle with standard 22-G needles. Methods: In this prospective, randomized two-center trial, patients with CT findings suggestive of lung cancer and mediastinal or hilar lymph node metastases were randomized to 19-G or 22-G EBUS-TBNA. Blood content (score 0-2) was assessed, samples were weighed, tumor cells counted per slide, and complications and final diagnoses recorded. Results: 107 patients were enrolled (53 in 19-G group; 54 in 22-G group). 19-G yielded significantly greater sample weight after adjustment for blood content (P = .0119) and significantly higher tumor cell counts per slide in NSCLC-infiltrated nodes (P = .0312). Diagnostic yield was comparable. Four moderate bleeding events occurred (2 per group); hemostasis was rapidly achieved. Conclusions: 19-G EBUS-TBNA provides significantly more tissue and tumor cells per slide with a safety profile similar to 22-G needles.",
      "methods": "Prospective randomized two-center trial (University Hospital Essen, Germany; University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland) from April 2016 to October 2017. Adults with suspected lung cancer and mediastinal/hilar lymph nodes ≥10 mm on CT were included. Exclusions: pregnancy, age <18 years, standard EBUS-TBNA exclusions (coagulopathy, INR >1.5, clinical instability), inability to consent. Randomization (simple, Excel-generated) allocated patients to 19-G (NA-U402SX-4019; Olympus) or 22-G (NA-201SX-4022; Olympus) EBUS needles. Operators were experienced pulmonologists; no additional suction used. Patients and pathologists were blinded to needle size. Standardized EBUS-TBNA with complete mediastinal/hilar staging; target node sampled with 3-5 passes (10-15 thrusts/pass). Samples expelled into 5 mL 4% buffered formalin. Blood content scored 0-2 visually. Each node sample weighed on precision balance and divided by number of passes. Cytopathology via ThinPrep or direct smears; cell blocks prepared; tumor cells manually counted on H&E slides. Primary endpoint: sample weight corrected for blood content. Secondary endpoints: tumor cell count, diagnostic yield, complications. Statistics: Normality tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov; log10 transformation applied. Two-sample t tests compared log10-transformed outcomes. Chi-square assessed association between blood content and needle size. ANOVA studied association between log10 sample weight and blood content. ANCOVA assessed association between log10 sample weight and needle size controlling for blood content. Power: 80% to detect effect size 0.59 SD at alpha 0.05.",
      "results": "107 patients randomized (53 to 19-G; 54 to 22-G). Mean 3 passes per node; lymph node diameters similar between groups. Mean sample weight per pass: 20.0 mg (19-G) vs 10.2 mg (22-G). Log10-transformed sample weight significantly larger with 19-G (two-sample t test P = .0016). Larger needle associated with higher blood content (score 2 in 22/53 [41.51%] for 19-G vs 10/54 [18.52%] for 22-G; chi-square P = .029). After controlling for blood content, 19-G remained significantly higher in sample weight (ANCOVA P = .0119). EBUS-TBNA diagnostic in 93/107 (86.9%). NSCLC diagnosed in 67/107 (62.6%); study node tumor-infiltrated in 43 patients (23 in 19-G; 20 in 22-G). Tumor cells were counted in 37/43 NSCLC-infiltrated nodes (20 in 19-G; 17 in 22-G); average tumor cell count per slide higher with 19-G (P = .0312). Complications: four moderate bleeding events (2/53 [3.8%] in 19-G; 2/54 [3.7%] in 22-G), all controlled with xylometazoline; no other complications reported."
