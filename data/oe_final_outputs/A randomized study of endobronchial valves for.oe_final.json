      "abstract": "Background: Endobronchial valves that allow air to escape from a pulmonary lobe but not enter it can induce a reduction in lobar volume that may thereby improve lung function and exercise tolerance in patients with pulmonary hyperinflation related to advanced emphysema. Methods: We compared the safety and efficacy of endobronchial-valve therapy in patients with heterogeneous emphysema versus standard medical care. Efficacy end points were percent changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the 6-minute walk test on intention-to-treat analysis. We assessed safety on the basis of the rate of a composite of six major complications. Results: Of 321 enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to receive endobronchial valves (EBV group) and 101 to receive standard medical care (control group). At 6 months, there was an increase of 4.3% in the FEV1 in the EBV group (an increase of 1.0 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value), as compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the control group (a decrease of 0.9 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value). Thus, there was a mean between-group difference of 6.8% in the FEV1 (P=0.005). Roughly similar between-group differences were observed for the 6-minute walk test. At 12 months, the rate of the complications composite was 10.3% in the EBV group versus 4.6% in the control group (P=0.17). At 90 days, in the EBV group, as compared with the control group, there were increased rates of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs. 1.1%, P=0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs. 0%, P=0.01). The rate of pneumonia in the target lobe in the EBV group was 4.2% at 12 months. Greater radiographic evidence of emphysema heterogeneity and fissure completeness was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. Conclusions: Endobronchial-valve treatment for advanced heterogeneous emphysema induced modest improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms at the cost of more frequent exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, and hemoptysis after implantation. (Funded by Pulmonx; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT00129584.)",
      "methods": "From December 2004 through April 2006, 977 patients were screened at 31 U.S. centers; 321 were enrolled and randomized 2:1 to receive Zephyr endobronchial valves (EBV, n=220) or standard medical care (control, n=101). Eligibility included age 40-75 years, heterogeneous emphysema, FEV1 15-45% predicted, total lung capacity >100% predicted, residual volume >150% predicted, BMI ≤31.1 (men) or ≤32.3 (women), PaCO2 <50 mm Hg, PaO2 >45 mm Hg on room air, and 6-minute walk distance ≥140 m after rehabilitation. Exclusions included diffusing capacity <20% predicted, giant bullae, α1-antitrypsin deficiency, prior thoracotomy, excessive sputum, severe pulmonary hypertension, active infection, or unstable cardiac conditions. Before randomization, patients completed 6-8 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation and optimized guideline-directed medical therapy. Quantitative and visual HRCT assessed emphysema severity, heterogeneity, and fissure integrity; targeting used core lab analysis. No sham procedure was used. Coprimary efficacy endpoints were percent change in FEV1 and 6-minute walk distance at 6 months (intention-to-treat). The primary safety endpoint was a 6-event composite at 6 months (death, empyema, massive hemoptysis, pneumonia distal to valves, pneumothorax or air leak >7 days, or ventilator-dependent respiratory failure >24 hours). Secondary endpoints included SGRQ, incremental cycle ergometry, dyspnea (MMRC), and oxygen use. Statistical plan prespecified analyses; missing data were imputed by regression imputation based on baseline factors. Mixed linear models (PROC MIXED) evaluated effects of predefined covariates and interactions.",
      "results": "Of 321 randomized, 220 were assigned to EBV and 101 to control; 214 received EBV. At 6 months, FEV1 increased by 4.3% (95% CI, 1.4 to 7.2) in EBV and decreased by 2.5% (95% CI, -5.4 to 0.4) in control; mean between-group difference 6.8% (95% CI, 2.1 to 11.5; P=0.005). Six-minute walk distance increased by 2.5% (95% CI, -1.1 to 6.1) in EBV and decreased by 3.2% (95% CI, -8.9 to 2.4) in control; between-group difference 5.8% (95% CI, 0.5 to 11.2; P=0.04), corresponding to +9.3 m (95% CI, -0.5 to 19.1) vs -10.7 m (95% CI, -29.6 to 8.1) (P=0.02). Secondary outcomes showed modest improvements favoring EBV. By 6 months, the composite complications rate was 6.1% in EBV vs 1.2% in control (P=0.08). Between 6 and 12 months, rates were similar (4.7% vs 4.6%); overall 12-month composite 10.3% vs 4.6% (P=0.17). At 6 months there were 6 deaths (2.8%) in EBV vs 0 in control (P=0.19); causes included respiratory failure (3), cancer (1), ischemic colitis (1), and massive hemoptysis (1). Death by 12 months was 3.7% EBV vs 3.5% control (P=0.88). Pneumonia distal to valves occurred in 9 EBV patients (4.2%) by 12 months. At 90 days, EBV vs control had higher COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs 1.1%; P=0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs 0%; P=0.01). Greater emphysema heterogeneity and fissure completeness were associated with enhanced treatment response."
