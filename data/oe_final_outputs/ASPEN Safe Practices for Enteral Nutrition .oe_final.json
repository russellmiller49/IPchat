      "abstract": "Enteral nutrition (EN) is a valuable clinical intervention for patients of all ages in a variety of care settings. Along with its many outcome benefits come the potential for adverse effects. These safety issues are the result of clinical complications and of process-related errors. The latter can occur at any step from patient assessment, prescribing, and order review, to product selection, labeling, and administration. To maximize the benefits of EN while minimizing adverse events requires that a systematic approach of care be in place. This includes open communication, standardization, and incorporation of best practices into the EN process. This document provides recommendations based on the available evidence and expert consensus for safe practices, across each step of the process, for all those involved in caring for patients receiving EN.",
      "methods": "An interdisciplinary ASPEN task force identified key safety-related questions across the EN use process, including assessment, prescribing, order review, access, product handling, administration, monitoring, and transitions of care. Section leads conducted English-language literature searches, reviewed evidence, and weighed risks versus benefits to formulate best-practice recommendations. Draft sections were reviewed by the task force, with consensus reached through discussion. The document underwent internal and external review and was approved by the ASPEN Board of Directors. Recommendations are intended to guide organizational adoption over time and do not supersede clinician judgment.",
      "results": "This consensus guideline provides practice recommendations to enhance safety of enteral nutrition across the full process: assessment and recommendations; prescribing and communication; order review; enteral access; procurement, selection/preparation, labeling, and dispensing; administration (general, tube patency, and medication delivery); complication avoidance and error reporting; monitoring and reassessment; transition of care; and documentation and quality review. Emphasis is placed on standardization, effective communication, competency maintenance, and the use of system-level safeguards. No clinical trial outcomes or comparative efficacy/effectiveness results are reported."
