      "abstract": "Aims In advanced-stage non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), incomplete genotyping for guideline-recommended genomic biomarkers poses a significant challenge to making informed and timely clinical decisions. We report our institution’s experience in assessing the adequacy of small specimens for comprehensive genomic profiling for guideline- recommended lung cancer biomarker testing. Methods We performed a retrospective evaluation of all image-guided procedures for NSCLC performed in our institution between October 2016 and July 2018, including core needle biopsy (CNB) and fine-needle aspiration (FNA) in patients who had undergone genomic profiling for lung cancer. Lung cancer biomarker adequacy, defined as successful testing of guideline-recommended biomarkers including, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); serine/threonine protein kinase B-Raf (BRAF); anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK); proto-oncogene tyrosine protein kinase ROS (ROS1); Rearranged during Transfection (RET); Tyrosine protein kinase Met (MET); and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), was evaluated. Results A total of 865 cases were evaluated in this study, 785 of which included testing of all lung cancer biomarkers. Lung tissue was adequate for biomarker testing in 84% of cases; this rate increased to 87% when biomarker testing was combined with concurrently acquired FNA or CNB specimens. Biomarker testing success correlated strongly with DNA concentration (p<0.0001) and the use of 22G needles in endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) procedures (p=0.0035). Biomarker testing of CNB specimens showed a significantly higher success rate than did biomarker testing of cytology FNA specimens (p=0.0005). The adequacy of EBUS-TBNA samples was not significantly different from that of the transthoracic needle aspiration samples (p=0.40). Variables such as age, gender, lesion size, site, diagnosis and number of needle passes showed no significant correlation with success rates in lung cancer biomarker testing. Conclusion The growing numbers of therapeutic biomarkers in NSCLC requires judicious triage of limited-volume tissue from small specimens. Our study showed that thoracic small tissue specimens can be used successfully to provide prognostic and predictive information for the current guideline-recommended biomarkers for NSCLC in most cases.",
      "methods": "We retrospectively identified consecutive malignant small specimens (CNB and FNA samples) that were collected in-house via image-guided procedures, performed between October 2016 and July 2018, for lung biomarker testing. These included procedures performed by interventional radiologists (IR) under CT or ultrasound guidance as well as by interventional pulmonologists using endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) guidance. Only cases with a lung biomarker request that included the molecular markers outlined by current NCCN guidelines (EGFR, BRAF, ALK, ROS1, RET, MET exon 14 skipping, and PD-L1) were included. Biomarker requests at our institution are usually performed on the CNB sample and reflexed to the concurrent FNA sample if the CNB is inadequate for testing or if the FNA is the only specimen available. FNA procedures were performed with rapid on-site evaluation; cell blocks and FFPE sections were prepared per standard protocols. DNA-based NGS (Ion Torrent) was used for mutations (EGFR, BRAF, MET, KRAS, ERBB2); fusions (ALK, ROS1, RET, MET) were tested by FISH and in a subset by RNA-based NGS; PD-L1 IHC used the 22C3 clone. The tested sample was considered adequate if all listed biomarkers were successfully performed. NTRK was excluded from adequacy statistics due to limited availability of RNA-based fusion testing. Statistical analyses used Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables and Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables (R v3.6.1; significance P<0.005).",
      "results": "A total of 865 cases were evaluated: CNB (n=679), EBUS-TBNA FNA (n=150), and IR FNA (n=36). Median age was 67 years (range 26-97), 48% male (n=417) and 52% female (n=448). Lesion sites included lung (n=467), lymph node (n=210), liver (n=44), pleura (n=39), soft tissue (n=36), bone (n=30), adrenal (n=29), mediastinum (n=6), kidney (n=3), and stomach (n=1). Diagnoses were mainly adenocarcinoma (n=643), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (n=87), neuroendocrine carcinomas including small-cell carcinoma (n=41), poorly differentiated carcinoma (n=34), NSCLC NOS (n=26), carcinoma NOS (n=26), malignant neoplasm NOS (n=5), and sarcomatoid neoplasm (n=3). For CNB with available device data (n=412), 20G was most common (n=331; 80%), followed by 18G (n=80; 19%); coaxial guide needles were used in 366 procedures. Most CNBs had 2-3 cores; median lesion size was 2 cm. A concurrent FNA was present for 419/679 (62%) CNBs. Among CNBs with adverse event documentation (n=417), pneumothorax occurred in 63 (15%), with chest tubes required in a subset (4.5%). IR FNA cases used 22G needles in available data (n=22), median 2 passes; adverse events were recorded in 19 cases with pneumothorax in 2 (both with concurrent CNB) and none in 17. EBUS-TBNA predominantly used 22G needles (133/144; 92%), median 6 passes; no adverse events were noted. Median DNA yield was 0.02 µg/µL for CNB, 0.01 µg/µL for EBUS-TBNA, and 0.006 µg/µL for IR-FNA. Of 785 cases with a complete biomarker testing request, adequacy for all requested markers on the requested sample was 84% (659/785). When combining results from concurrent FNA/CNB specimens, overall adequacy increased to 87% (679/785). Success correlated with higher DNA concentration (p<0.0001) and use of 22G needles in EBUS-TBNA (p=0.0035). CNB had a higher success rate than cytology FNA (p=0.0005). Adequacy did not differ significantly between EBUS-TBNA and transthoracic needle aspiration samples (p=0.40). No significant associations were observed for age, gender, lesion size, site, diagnosis, or number of passes."
