      "abstract": "Advanced interventional pulmonary procedures of the airways, pleural space, and mediastinum continue to evolve and be refined. Health care, finance, and clinical professionals are challenged by both the indications and related coding complexities. As the scope of interventional pulmonary procedures expands with advanced technique and medical innovation, program planning and ongoing collaboration among clinicians, finance executives, and reimbursement experts are key elements for success. We describe advanced bronchoscopic procedures, appropriate Current Procedural Terminology coding, valuations, and necessary modifiers to fill the knowledge gap between basic and advanced procedural coding. Our approach is to balance the description of procedures with the associated coding in a way that is of use to the proceduralist, the coding specialist, and other nonclinical professionals.",

      "results": "The review summarizes technologies including convex EBUS-guided TBNA, RP-EBUS, ENB, electromagnetic navigation-guided TTNA, fiducial marker placement, dye marking, airway dilation, airway stenting, ablative techniques (laser, electrosurgery, argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy), and photodynamic therapy. Reported diagnostic yields from cited studies include RP-EBUS 49%-69% and ENB 38.5% alone up to 70.6% combined with RP-EBUS. Reported complication rates include pneumothorax 3.1%-4.9% (about half requiring drainage) and bleeding 2.3% for ENB; for a 24-subject pilot of electromagnetic navigation-guided TTNA, diagnostic yield was 83% alone and 92% combined with ENB and convex EBUS, with pneumothorax 21% and 8% requiring drainage. Bronchoscopic fiducial placement had pneumothorax rates <5% vs 47% for transthoracic approaches. Detailed CPT code descriptors and wRVUs are provided for advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy, including add-on codes and modifier usage."
