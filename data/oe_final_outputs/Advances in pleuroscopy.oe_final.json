      "abstract": "Objectives: To describe the technique of pleuroscopy, its clinical uses such as diagnosis of exudative pleural effusion, treatment of pleural infection, treatment of pneumothorax, and diagnosis and pleurodesis of malignant pleural mesothelioma. Also to describe the newer techniques developed such as minothoracoscopy, semi-rigid thoracoscopy, narrow band imaging pleuroscopy, infrared pleuroscopy, autofluorescence pleuroscopy. Data source: We searched the pubmed the last decade for publications with the key words pleuroscopy, medical thoracoscopy, pneumothorax and pleuroscopy, malignant pleural mesothelioma, minothoracoscopy, semirigid thoracoscopy, auto-fluorescence pleuroscopy. Conclusion: Medical thoracoscopy is the method of choice for investigation of the undiagnosed exudative pleural effusions. Newer techniques, such as narrow band imaging thoracoscopy, infrared thoracoscopy, autofluorescence thoracoscopy are offering a promising future for medical thoracoscopy.",
      "methods": "Narrative review. PubMed was searched over the last decade using keywords: pleuroscopy, medical thoracoscopy, pneumothorax and pleuroscopy, malignant pleural mesothelioma, minithoracoscopy, semirigid thoracoscopy, autofluorescence pleuroscopy.",
      "results": "The review summarizes technical aspects and diagnostic performance of medical thoracoscopy/pleuroscopy. Reported sensitivity for malignant pleural effusion is 92-97% and specificity 99-100%. Thoracoscopy offers high diagnostic yield in malignant pleural mesothelioma (>90%), outperforming fluid cytology and closed needle biopsy in historical series. In pleural infection, early medical thoracoscopy can achieve high success rates (e.g., 91% in a cohort of multiloculated effusions) with low complication rates, and may reduce the need for surgical intervention when coordinated with surgical teams. Talc poudrage via thoracoscopy is considered the gold-standard pleurodesis for malignant effusions (>90% efficacy) and is also effective for preventing recurrence in primary spontaneous pneumothorax compared with chest tube drainage alone in a European randomized study. Advances include semi-rigid pleuroscopy (comparable diagnostic accuracy to rigid), techniques to improve biopsy depth (insulated-tip knife, cryobiopsy), and mini-thoracoscopy for reduced pain and access to loculations. Emerging imaging modalities (narrow band, infrared, autofluorescence pleuroscopy) may enhance detection and characterization."
