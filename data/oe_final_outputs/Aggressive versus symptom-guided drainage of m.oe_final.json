      "abstract": "Background: Indwelling pleural catheters are an established management option for malignant pleural effusion and have advantages over talc slurry pleurodesis. The optimal regimen of drainage after indwelling pleural catheter insertion is debated and ranges from aggressive (daily) drainage to drainage only when symptomatic. Methods: AMPLE-2 was an open-label randomised trial involving 11 centres in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Patients with symptomatic malignant pleural effusions were randomly assigned (1:1) to the aggressive (daily) or symptom-guided drainage groups for 60 days and minimised by cancer type (mesothelioma vs others), performance status (ECOG 0-1 vs ≥2), presence of trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis. Patients were followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome was mean daily breathlessness score, measured by a 100 mm visual analogue scale during the first 60 days. Secondary outcomes included rates of spontaneous pleurodesis and self-reported quality-of-life measures. Analyses were intention-to-treat. Findings: 87 patients were randomised to aggressive (n=43) or symptom-guided (n=44) drainage. Mean daily breathlessness scores did not differ significantly (geometric means 13.1 mm [95% CI 9.8-17.4] vs 17.3 mm [13.0-22.0]; ratio of geometric means 1.32 [95% CI 0.88-1.97]; p=0.18). More patients in the aggressive group developed spontaneous pleurodesis than in the symptom-guided group in the first 60 days (16/43 [37.2%] vs 5/44 [11.4%], p=0.0049) and at 6 months (19/43 [44.2%] vs 7/44 [15.9%], p=0.004; hazard ratio 3.287 [95% CI 1.396-7.740]; p=0.0065). EQ-5D-5L index values were higher with aggressive drainage (estimated means 0.713 [95% CI 0.647-0.779] vs 0.601 [0.536-0.667]; difference 0.112 [95% CI 0.0198-0.204]; p=0.0174). Pain scores, total days in hospital, and mortality did not differ significantly. Serious adverse events occurred in 11/43 (25.6%) vs 12/44 (27.3%), including 11 episodes of pleural infection in nine patients (five episodes in the aggressive group and six in the symptom-guided group). Interpretation: No difference between daily and symptom-guided regimens in breathlessness control; daily drainage increased spontaneous pleurodesis and might improve quality of life.",
      "methods": "Randomised, multicentre, open-label trial at 11 centres in Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. Adults with symptomatic malignant pleural effusions requiring indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) were randomised 1:1 within 72 h of IPC insertion to aggressive (daily) drainage or symptom-guided drainage for 60 days. Randomisation used a central automated voice-response system with minimisation by cancer type (mesothelioma vs non-mesothelioma), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs ≥2), presence of trapped lung, and prior pleurodesis; an imbalance window ensured allocation concealment. Primary outcome was mean daily breathlessness VAS (0-100 mm) during days 1-60 post-randomisation. Secondary outcomes: spontaneous pleurodesis, EQ-5D-5L and VAS QoL, pain VAS, hospitalisations, adverse events, survival. Pleurodesis was defined as <50 mL drained at three consecutive drainages (aggressive arm) or at two attempts 2 weeks apart (symptom-guided arm) with no substantial residual fluid on imaging. Follow-up to 6 months or death. Analyses were intention-to-treat.",
      "results": "87 patients were randomised: aggressive daily drainage n=43; symptom-guided n=44. Mean daily breathlessness geometric means during days 1-60: 13.1 mm (95% CI 9.8-17.4) vs 17.3 mm (13.0-22.0); ratio 1.32 (95% CI 0.88-1.97); p=0.18. Spontaneous pleurodesis by 60 days: 16/43 (37.2%) vs 5/44 (11.4%), p=0.0049. By 6 months: 19/43 (44.2%) vs 7/44 (15.9%), p=0.004; HR 3.287 (95% CI 1.396-7.740); p=0.0065. EQ-5D-5L estimated means: 0.713 (95% CI 0.647-0.779) vs 0.601 (0.536-0.667); difference 0.112 (95% CI 0.0198-0.204); p=0.0174. Pain scores, total hospital days, and mortality: no significant between-group differences. Serious adverse events: 11/43 (25.6%) vs 12/44 (27.3%); pleural infection episodes: 5 vs 6 (11 total episodes in nine patients)."
