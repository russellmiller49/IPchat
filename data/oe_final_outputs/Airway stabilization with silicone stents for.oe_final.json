      "abstract": "Rationale: In patients with severe tracheobronchomalacia (TBM), airway stabilization with stents may relieve symptoms. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of silicone stents (tracheal, mainstem bronchus, or both) on symptoms, quality of life, lung function, and exercise capacity. Methods: Prospective observational study comparing baseline measurements to those obtained 10-14 days after stent placement. Measurements and main results: Of 75 patients referred, 58 had severe TBM and underwent rigid bronchoscopy with silicone stent placement. Mean age was 69 years (range 39-91); 34 were men; 33 had COPD; 13 had asthma. Almost all (n=57) had dyspnea; four required mechanical ventilation. Symptomatic improvement was reported in 45/58 patients; quality of life (SGRQ) improved in 19/27 (p=0.002); dyspnea (BDI/TDI) improved in 22/24 (p=0.001); ATS dyspnea improved in 21/29 (p<0.001); Karnofsky performance improved in 18/26 (p=0.002); mean exercise capacity improved but not significantly. There were 49 complications, mainly 21 partial stent obstructions, 14 infections, and 10 stent migrations. Most patients with COPD improved on most measures. Conclusions: Short-term airway stabilization with silicone stents in severe TBM can improve respiratory symptoms, quality of life, and functional status; COPD is not an absolute contraindication. Stenting is associated with numerous but generally reversible complications.",
      "methods": "Prospective, single-center observational study (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center) from January 2002 to September 2006. Adults referred for respiratory symptoms presumed due to TBM underwent dynamic airway CT and functional bronchoscopy. Severe TBM was defined as near-total or total airway collapse (approximation of posterior and anterior luminal surfaces) on bronchoscopy while on maximal medical therapy. Silicone stents (tracheal, bronchial, or Y-shaped) were placed under general anesthesia with rigid bronchoscopy and jet ventilation. Baseline assessments included symptoms, SGRQ (modified to 2-week recall), BDI/TDI, ATS dyspnea score, KPS, spirometry (ATS standards), and 6MWT (ATS standards). Follow-up occurred 10-14 days post-procedure with repetition of baseline measures and inquiry regarding symptomatic improvement. Clinically important thresholds: FEV1 change ≥0.2 L; 6MWT improvement ≥230 ft. Statistical analysis used Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (two-tailed, alpha=0.05).",
      "results": "Of 75 referred, 58 had severe TBM and underwent stenting. Comorbidities included COPD (n=33), asthma (n=13), OSA (n=16), GERD (n=16), and Mounier-Kuhn syndrome (n=3). Nearly all (n=57) had dyspnea; four required mechanical ventilation and were weaned after stenting. Most (n=46) had diffuse TBM and received either combined tracheal and left main stent (n=19) or Y-stent (n=27); six received bronchial-only and six tracheal-only stents. Follow-up cohort sizes: SGRQ (n=27), BDI/TDI (n=24), ATS dyspnea (n=29), KPS (n=26), 6MWT (n=17), FEV1 (n=10). Improvements: SGRQ improved in 19/27 (p=0.002); BDI/TDI improved in 22/24 (p=0.001); ATS dyspnea improved in 21/29 (p<0.001); KPS improved in 18/26 (p=0.002); 6MWT improved in 10/17 (p=0.28); FEV1 improved in 4/10 (p=0.79). Self-reported symptomatic improvement occurred in 45/58 overall (25/33 COPD; 20/25 non-COPD). Complications (median onset 26 days; range 3-865) totaled 49: stent-related (n=44) including partial stent obstruction from mucus plugging (n=21), infection (n=14), stent migration (n=10); bronchoscopy-related (n=5); none anesthesia-related."
