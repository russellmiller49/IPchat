      "abstract": "Stents and tubes to maintain the patency of the airways are commonly used for malignant obstruction and are occasionally employed in benign disease. Malignant airway obstruction usually results from direct involvement of bronchogenic carcinoma, or by extension of carcinomas occurring in the esophagus or the thyroid. External compression from lymph nodes or metastatic disease from other organs can also cause central airway obstruction. Most malignant airway lesions are surgically inoperable due to advanced disease stage and require multimodality palliation, including stent placement. As with any other medical device, stents have significantly evolved over the last 50 years and deserve an in-depth understanding of their true capabilities and complications. Not every silicone stent is created equal and the same holds for metallic stents. Herein, we present an overview of the topic as well as some of the more practical and controversial issues surrounding airway stents. We also try to dispel the myths surrounding stent removal and their supposed use only in central airways. At the end, we come to the long-held conclusion that stents should not be used as first line treatment of choice, but after ruling out the possibility of curative surgical resection or repair.",
      "methods": "Perspective narrative review of airway stents. The article synthesizes prior literature and expert experience on indications, materials, types, placement techniques, and complications of airway stents. No systematic search strategy, randomization, or formal quantitative meta-analysis was performed.",
      "results": "Airway stenting is indicated for malignant central airway obstruction (extrinsic compression, residual obstruction after debulking, mixed lesions, loss of cartilage support), malignant tracheoesophageal fistula, and select benign conditions (complex strictures >4 cm, inoperable strictures, post-transplant airway stenosis, tracheobronchomalacia trialing before tracheoplasty, benign tracheoesophageal fistula). Metallic stents are generally discouraged as first-line in benign disease per a 2005 FDA warning. Stent options include silicone (tubular, T-tube, Y-stents), metallic (self-expanding nitinol, balloon-expandable), and hybrid covered stents. Advantages of silicone stents include ease of removal and customization; common complications include migration (9.5%) and obstruction from secretions (3.6%). Metallic stents offer easier deployment with flexible bronchoscopy and lower migration but risk tissue ingrowth and difficult removal; uncovered designs are now limited to select indications (e.g., post-transplant anastomotic dehiscence). Hybrid covered metallic stents reduce ingrowth but may increase sputum retention; externally covered stents have migration rates of 18-22%, while an internally silicone-covered design reported a 4% migration rate in a recent study. Device-specific characteristics, sizes, and placement techniques are summarized, emphasizing individualized selection based on disease, anatomy, and clinician expertise."
