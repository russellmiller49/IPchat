      "abstract": "Background: The concerns regarding air leak following lung surgery or spontaneous pneumothorax include detection and duration. Prior studies have suggested that digital drainage systems permit a shorter chest tube duration and hospital length of stay (LOS) by earlier detection of air leak cessation. We conducted a systematic review to assess the impact of digital drainage on chest tube duration and hospital LOS following pulmonary surgery and spontaneous pneumothorax. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar were searched from inception through January 2019. We included randomized controlled trials, cohort studies, and case series of adult patients using digital or traditional drainage devices for air leaks of either post-surgical or spontaneous pneumothorax origin. Results: Of 1,272 references reviewed, 23 articles were included. Nineteen articles addressed post-operative air leak, while 4 articles pertained to air leak after spontaneous pneumothorax. Thirteen studies were randomized controlled trials. Digital drainage resulted in significantly shorter chest tube duration in 8 of 18 studies and shorter hospital LOS in 6 of 14 studies for post-operative air leak. For post-pneumothorax air leak, digital drainage resulted in a significantly shorter chest tube duration in 2 of 3 studies and hospital LOS in 1 of 2 studies with an analog control group. Conclusions: Most studies show no significant differences in chest tube duration and hospital LOS with digital versus analog drainage systems for patients with air leak after pulmonary resection. For post spontaneous pneumothorax air leak, the limited published evidence suggests a shorter chest tube duration and hospital LOS with analog drainage systems.",
      "methods": "The following population, intervention, comparison, and outcome (PICO) questions were developed to guide this systematic review: (1) Among patients with an air leak after thoracic surgery, do digital drainage devices compared with conventional drainage devices reduce chest tube duration and/or hospital LOS? (2) Among patients with an air leak after spontaneous pneumothorax, do digital drainage devices compared with conventional drainage devices reduce chest tube duration and/or hospital LOS? A comprehensive search of the literature was performed in January 2019 in Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception. Bibliographies of relevant primary studies and systematic reviews were checked. Meeting abstracts were reviewed for subsequently published research. Inclusion: original research studies evaluating digital drainage devices in adults with ongoing air leak after pulmonary surgery or spontaneous pneumothorax, reporting chest tube duration and/or hospital LOS. Exclusion: systematic reviews, narrative reviews, meta-analyses, comments, case reports, crossover studies, letters, and editorials. Data were abstracted into an evidence table. Study quality was assessed using a modified Downs and Black checklist (maximum score 28). Heterogeneity in study types and outcomes precluded meta-analysis; therefore, results were synthesized qualitatively.",
      "results": "A total of 1,272 references were identified; after removing 544 duplicates, 728 titles/abstracts were screened; 49 full texts were reviewed; 23 studies were included. Nineteen studies addressed post-operative air leak and four addressed spontaneous pneumothorax. Thirteen studies were randomized controlled trials. Quality assessment: mean Downs and Black score 21.13 (range 15-25); 16 good and 7 fair quality. Post-operative air leak: Digital systems yielded significantly shorter chest tube duration in 8 of 18 studies with an analog control; mean chest tube duration ranged 1.7-5.5 days (digital) vs 1.9-6.1 days (analog). Digital systems yielded significantly shorter hospital LOS in 6 of 14 studies with an analog control; mean LOS ranged 3.3-6.5 days (digital) vs 3.9-9.0 days (analog). Spontaneous pneumothorax: For chest tube duration, 2 of 3 studies with an analog control favored digital; means 47-96 hours (digital) vs 74-94 hours (analog). For LOS, 1 of 2 studies favored digital; means 3.5-5.1 days (digital) vs 4.0-7.0 days (analog). Chest tube re-insertion/recurrence was not different between groups in postoperative studies; in one spontaneous pneumothorax study, digital had lower recurrence/reinsertion (4.4% vs 14.0%, p=0.041). Cost: two postoperative studies and one pneumothorax study reported significant cost savings with digital systems (e.g., €476-€751 per hospitalization; ~€430 per patient for pneumothorax)."
