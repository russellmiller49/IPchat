      "abstract": "Background: Primary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in otherwise healthy young patients. Optimal management is not defined and often results in prolonged hospitalisation. Data on efficacy of ambulatory options are poor. We aimed to describe the duration of hospitalisation and safety of ambulatory management compared with standard care. Methods: In this open-label, randomised controlled trial, adults (aged 16-55 years) with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax were recruited from 24 UK hospitals during a period of 3 years. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to treatment with either an ambulatory device or standard guideline-based management (aspiration, standard chest tube insertion, or both). The primary outcome was total length of hospital stay including re-admission up to 30 days after randomisation. Patients with available data were included in the primary analysis and all assigned patients were included in the safety analysis. Findings: Of 776 patients screened between July, 2015, and March, 2019, 236 were randomly assigned to ambulatory care (n=117) and standard care (n=119). At day 30, the median hospitalisation was significantly shorter in those who received ambulatory treatment (0 days [IQR 0-3]) than in those who received standard care (4 days [IQR 0-8]; p<0.0001; median difference 2 days [95% CI 1-3]). 110 of 236 patients had adverse events, including 64 of 117 in the ambulatory care arm and 46 of 119 in the standard care arm. All 14 serious adverse events occurred in patients who received ambulatory care, eight of which were related to the intervention. Interpretation: Ambulatory management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduced the duration of hospitalisation including re-admissions in the first 30 days, but at the expense of increased adverse events.",
      "methods": "Multicentre, open-label, randomised controlled trial across 24 UK hospitals comparing an ambulatory device (Rocket Pleural Vent) to standard British Thoracic Society guideline-based management (aspiration, small-bore chest tube, or both). Adults aged 16-55 years with symptomatic primary spontaneous pneumothorax requiring intervention (large pneumothorax ≥2 cm at hilum and/or significant symptoms) were eligible. Exclusions included underlying lung disease (including >20 pack-years smoking history, excluding well-controlled asthma), tension pneumothorax, contraindication to thoracic procedures, pregnancy or lactation. Randomisation 1:1 via central web-based minimisation by centre and pneumothorax size (≥4 cm vs <4 cm). Primary outcome: total hospital days through day 30 including re-admissions. Secondary outcomes included need for further pleural procedures, adverse events, pain and breathlessness VAS, recurrence, and time off work. Ambulatory arm: 8F catheter with Heimlich valve; discharge criteria included clinical stability and support at home with frequent outpatient review. Control arm: aspiration recommended then small-bore chest tube if needed per BTS guidelines; discharge per standard criteria. Follow-up at 1 week post-treatment, 30 days, 6 and 12 months. Primary analysis included patients with available day-30 hospitalisation data; all randomised included for safety.",
      "results": "236 patients were randomised (ambulatory n=117; standard care n=119). Primary outcome (available-case): median total hospital days to day 30 were 0 (IQR 0-3) in ambulatory (n=114) vs 4 (IQR 0-8) in standard care (n=113), with a median difference of 2 days (95% CI 1-3), p<0.0001. Adverse events occurred in 64/117 (55%) ambulatory vs 46/119 (39%) standard care. All 14 serious adverse events occurred in the ambulatory arm; 8 were intervention-related (including enlarging pneumothorax, asymptomatic pulmonary oedema, and device malfunction/leak/dislodgement)."
