      "abstract": "PURPOSE: To update brachytherapy recommendations for pretreatment evaluation, treatment, and dosimetric issues for thoracic brachytherapy for lung cancer. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Members of the American Brachytherapy Society with expertise in thoracic brachytherapy updated recommendations for thoracic brachytherapy based on literature review and clinical experience. RESULTS: The American Brachytherapy Society consensus guidelines recommend the use of endobronchial brachytherapy for disease palliation in patients with central obstructing lesions, particularly in patients who have previously received external beam radiotherapy. The use of interstitial implants after incomplete resection may improve outcomes and provide enhanced palliation. Early reports support the use of CT-guided intratumoral volume implants within clinical studies. The use of brachytherapy routinely after sublobar resection is not generally recommended, unless within the confines of a clinical trial or a registry. CONCLUSIONS: American Brachytherapy Society recommendations for thoracic brachytherapy are provided. Practitioners are encouraged to follow these guidelines and to develop further clinical trials to examine this treatment modality to increase the evidence base for its use.",
      "methods": "Guideline development based on literature review and clinical experience by members of the American Brachytherapy Society with expertise in thoracic brachytherapy. Recommendations update prior ABS guidance (1993 and 2001) and encompass pretreatment evaluation, treatment planning, dose/fractionation, and dosimetric reporting.",
      "results": "Key recommendations include: CT simulation and CT-based 3D planning for endobronchial brachytherapy; prefer HDR or PDR techniques over LDR for endobronchial treatment; individualized dose prescription with attention to organ-at-risk proximity (notably blood vessels) to mitigate risks such as massive hemoptysis; report dose to target and at 10 mm from catheter center plus OAR doses; consider brachytherapy for palliation of central obstructing lesions, especially in previously irradiated patients; radical endobronchial brachytherapy alone or as boost generally within clinical trials; interstitial seed implants after incomplete resection generally within trials; postoperative CT planning and OAR dose reporting for interstitial implants; new dose/fractionation schemes summarized. Cited RCTs and series show no survival difference between fractionation schemes or addition of brachytherapy to EBRT in most settings, with some symptomatic benefits and higher re-expansion rates of collapsed lungs when brachytherapy is added in select scenarios."
