      "abstract": "The advent of advanced diagnostic bronchoscopy has shown an increased demand for anesthesiologists to administer anesthesia in the bronchoscopy suite. Procedures such as navigational bronchoscopy, airway stenting and advanced therapeutic procedures often require the presence of an anesthesiologist to manage these more complex patients and procedures. In this review we describe the various bronchoscopic procedures and anesthetic management and complications of these procedures at our institution The Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland Ohio.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of institutional practices and considerations for anesthesia in advanced bronchoscopic procedures at a single tertiary academic center. No predefined systematic search, no quantitative synthesis, and no statistical analyses were reported.",
      "results": "The review outlines three main general anesthesia approaches for advanced bronchoscopy: supraglottic airway, endotracheal tube, and rigid bronchoscopy. Induction commonly uses propofol and lidocaine; opioids are typically minimized. Total intravenous anesthesia with propofol infusion is preferred due to circuit leaks and frequent airway manipulations. Muscle relaxation is commonly used to reduce coughing and movement. Specific considerations are detailed for EBUS-TBNA and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy, where general anesthesia and immobility facilitate precise sampling, and for patients with anterior mediastinal masses, where airway and cardiovascular compression risks mandate careful preoperative assessment and positioning."
