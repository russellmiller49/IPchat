      "abstract": "Background: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) is a worldwide pandemic, with many patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Tracheostomy is not recommended by current guidelines as it is considered a superspreading event owing to aerosolization that unduly risks health care workers. Methods: Patients with severe COVID-19 who were on mechanical ventilation for 5 days or longer were evaluated for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. We developed a novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique that placed the bronchoscope alongside the endotracheal tube, not inside it, improving visualization during the procedure and allowing continued standard mechanical ventilation after positioning the inflated endotracheal tube cuff in the distal trachea to mitigate aerosolization risk. Results: From March 10 to April 15, 2020, 270 patients required invasive mechanical ventilation; 98 underwent percutaneous dilational tracheostomy. Mean time from intubation to procedure was 10.6 ± 5 days. At reporting, 32 patients (33%) no longer required mechanical ventilatory support, 19 (19%) had their tracheostomy tube downsized, and 8 (8%) were decannulated. Forty (41%) remained on full ventilator support, 19 (19%) were weaning, and 7 (7%) died of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Tracheostomy-related bleeding occurred in 5 patients; none of the health care providers had symptoms or tested positive for COVID-19. Conclusions: The novel percutaneous tracheostomy technique appears safe and effective for COVID-19 patients and safe for health care workers.",
      "methods": "Institutional analysis of all ICU patients at NYU Langone Health Manhattan campus (Mar 10-Apr 15, 2020) with confirmed COVID-19 and severe respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation. Entry criteria for percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT): COVID-19 positive, on mechanical ventilation ≥5 days with anticipated prolonged need or on ECMO >1 day; isolated respiratory failure except acute renal failure on dialysis/CRRT. Recommended ventilator settings for PDT: PEEP ≤12 mm Hg, FiO2 ≤60%, RR ≤25 breaths/min, PaCO2 ≤60 mm Hg. Exclusion: uncorrected coagulopathy, BMI >45 kg/m2, multiorgan failure. Novel PDT performed at bedside with full PPE. Bronchoscope inserted adjacent to ETT and advanced anterior to ETT through vocal cords; ETT cuff deflated and advanced to distal trachea, reinflated, ventilation restarted; needle, guidewire, and dilators used under bronchoscopic visualization; tracheostomy tube inserted with ventilation paused only briefly during open-air steps.",
      "results": "Of 270 intubated patients, 130 were evaluated for tracheostomy; 98 underwent bedside PDT with the novel technique. Mean age 57 years; 80 (82%) male; mean BMI 31 kg/m2; mean PaO2/FiO2 ratio 132 at intubation. The novel technique was successful in 96/98 (98%); 2 required standard PDT under apneic conditions while on ECMO due to inadequate visualization from severe edema. Six additional patients underwent open tracheostomy (not part of the 98). Mean time from start of mechanical ventilation to PDT was 10.6 ± 5 days. Mean follow-up after starting mechanical ventilation was 18 ± 5 days; after PDT, 11 ± 6 days. At follow-up: 40/98 (41%) on full ventilator support; 19/98 (19%) weaning; 32/98 (33%) off mechanical ventilatory support (4 discharged, 17 on noncritical care floors, 11 in ICU on trach collar); 19/98 (19%) downsized; 8/98 (8%) decannulated; 7/98 (7%) died of respiratory and multiorgan failure. Intraprocedural complications were not observed. Bleeding occurred in 5/98 (5.1%) within 48 hours (all on anticoagulation; 3 on ECMO); 1 required surgical exploration. Two accidental tracheostomy tube removals occurred. Among 8 tracheostomy team members, 4 tested by RT-PCR were negative; none had symptoms or missed work."
