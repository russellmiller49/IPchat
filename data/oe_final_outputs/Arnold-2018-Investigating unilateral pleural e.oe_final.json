      "abstract": "The vast majority of undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusions have fluid sent for cytological analysis. Despite widespread use, there is uncertainty about its sensitivity to diagnose malignant pleural effusions (MPEs). Our aim was to ascertain the utility of cytology using a large prospective cohort. Consecutive patients presenting with an undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusion were recruited to this UK-based study. All had pleural fluid sent for cytological analysis. Cytological sensitivity was based on the final diagnosis at 12 months, confirmed by two consultants. Over 8 years, 921 patients were recruited, of which 515 had a MPE. Overall sensitivity of fluid cytology to diagnose malignancy was 46% (95% CI 42-58%). There was variation in sensitivity depending on cancer primary, with mesothelioma (6%) and haematological malignancies (40%) being significantly lower than adenocarcinomas (79%). MPEs secondary to ovarian cancer had high pick-up rates (95%). In asbestos-exposed males with exudative effusions, the risk of MPE was 60%, but cytological sensitivity was 11%. This is the largest prospective study of pleural fluid cytology and informs discussions with patients about the likely requirement for investigations following thoracentesis. In patients presenting with a clinical suspicion of mesothelioma, cytological sensitivity is low, so more definitive investigations could be performed sooner.",
      "methods": "Consecutive patients referred to a single-centre pleural service with an undiagnosed unilateral pleural effusion were recruited prospectively (Dec 2008-Dec 2016). All underwent diagnostic thoracentesis with routine pleural fluid analysis (protein, glucose, LDH, pH, microbiology, cytology). As per guidelines, 40 mL of pleural fluid was sent for cytological analysis where possible; slides and a formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell block were prepared and reviewed by a consultant cytopathologist. Immunohistochemistry panels (e.g., EMA, BerEP4/AUA1, CK5/6, calretinin, CK7, CK20, TTF1, ER/PR, Ca125) and flow cytometry for lymphoma were used when indicated. Patients were followed to 12 months or death. Final diagnoses were assigned by two independent consultant respiratory physicians using predefined criteria (malignancy by cytology/biopsy; histology with pleural metastasis on CT; progressive radiologic changes per Leung’s criteria; or autopsy). Light’s criteria distinguished exudates vs transudates. Sensitivity estimates with 95% CIs were calculated; z-tests compared sensitivities between groups (p<0.05 significance).",
      "results": "921 patients were enrolled; median pleural fluid volume sent for cytology was 40 mL (IQR 35-40). Mean age 70.2±13.8 years; 601 male, 320 female. At 12 months, 515/921 (56%) had malignant effusions. Overall pleural fluid cytology was diagnostic in 239/515 malignant effusions (46.4%, 95% CI 42.0-58.2). Sensitivity varied by cancer: breast 41/58 (70.7%), gastrointestinal 15/22 (68.2%), haematological 12/30 (40.0%), lung (all) 93/166 (56.0%) with lung adenocarcinoma 82/100 (82.0%), squamous 4/28 (14.3%), small cell 7/16 (43.8%), lung other/unknown 0/22 (0%); mesothelioma 9/148 (6.1%); sarcoma/melanoma 0/8 (0%); ovarian 36/38 (94.7%); urological 2/17 (11.8%); unknown malignancy 7/21 (33.3%). Of 276 nondiagnostic malignant effusions, 248 (90%) had definitive histocytological confirmation (65% pleural biopsy, 24% nonpleural biopsy with pleural metastasis on imaging, 1% post-mortem). Repeat cytology was obtained in 106 nondiagnostic cases; 6/106 (5.6%) became diagnostic; a third sample (n=30) yielded 0/30. Sending >40 mL vs ≤40 mL showed no difference in sensitivity (48% vs 40%; p=0.65). Risk of malignancy was 21/118 (15%) in transudates and 495/803 (62%) in exudates. Among asbestos-exposed men without prior cancer, cytology sensitivity was 11% (95% CI 6-17%), significantly lower than other groups (p<0.01), with malignancy risk >60%. Median survival for all malignant effusions was 199 days (IQR 74-465); within lung adenocarcinoma, survival did not differ by cytology diagnostic status (114 vs 97 days; p=0.13)."
