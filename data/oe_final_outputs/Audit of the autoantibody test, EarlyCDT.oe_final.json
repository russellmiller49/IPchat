      "abstract": "Objectives: EarlyCDT-Lung may enhance detection of early stage lung cancer by aiding physicians in assessing high-risk patients through measurement of biological markers (i.e., autoantibodies). The test’s performance characteristics in routine clinical practice were evaluated by auditing clinical outcomes of 1613 US patients deemed at high risk for lung cancer by their physician, who ordered the EarlyCDT-Lung test for their patient. Methods: Clinical outcomes for all 1613 patients who provided HIPAA authorization are reported. Clinical data were collected from each patient’s treating physician. Pathology reports when available were reviewed for diagnostic classification. Staging was assessed on histology, otherwise on imaging. Results: Six month follow-up for the positives/negatives was 99%/93%. Sixty-one patients (4%) were identified with lung cancer, 25 of whom tested positive by EarlyCDT-Lung (sensitivity = 41%). A positive EarlyCDT-Lung test on the current panel was associated with a 5.4-fold increase in lung cancer incidence versus a negative. Importantly, 57% (8/14) of non-small cell lung cancers detected as positive (where stage was known) were stage I or II. Conclusions: EarlyCDT-Lung has been extensively tested and validated in case-control settings and has now been shown in this audit to perform in routine clinical practice as predicted. EarlyCDT-Lung may be a complementary tool to CT for detection of early lung cancer.",
      "methods": "Audit population: The first 1699 patients for whom US physicians ordered EarlyCDT-Lung are described. Of these, 1613 (95%) signed a HIPAA authorization permitting disclosure of health information and were followed for clinical outcomes. Tests were ordered by 810 unique physicians in 720 practices across 48 US states. The EarlyCDT-Lung panel was modified in November 2010 from a 6 autoantibody (6AAB) panel to a 7 autoantibody (7AAB) panel to improve specificity. EarlyCDT-Lung assay: Autoantibodies to a panel of lung cancer-associated antigens were measured using a semi-automated indirect ELISA in a CLIA-certified laboratory. A result was positive if any one or more autoantibody levels were above the clinical cut-off with a dose response on titration. Audit plan: Demographic data were collected at test requisition. Clinical follow-up was obtained from treating physicians for patients who provided HIPAA authorization. Physicians of patients with positive tests were contacted immediately after reporting and followed until diagnosis or follow-up plan. All patients (regardless of test result) were queried at 6 months for cancer diagnoses. One positive case diagnosed just outside 6 months was included as the patient was under active investigation within 6 months. Statistical analyses: Sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated. Comparisons between 6AAB and 7AAB panels used chi-squared tests. Confidence intervals were computed using the Clopper-Pearson method.",
      "results": "Of 1613 consented patients, 14 had invalid results. Among 1599 valid tests, 222 (14%) were positive and 1377 (86%) were negative. By panel, 6AAB had 139/752 (18%) positives and 613/752 (82%) negatives; 7AAB had 83/847 (10%) positives and 764/847 (90%) negatives. Within 6 months, 61 patients (4%) were diagnosed with lung cancer: 25 positive (true positives) and 36 negative (false negatives), giving an overall sensitivity of 25/61 (41%). There were 1341/1538 non-cancer patients testing negative (true negatives) and 197 false positives, yielding overall specificity of 1341/1538 (87%). By panel, specificity improved with 7AAB vs 6AAB: 742/812 (91%) vs 599/726 (83%), p < 0.0001. Sensitivity did not differ significantly: 13/35 (37%) for 7AAB vs 12/26 (46%) for 6AAB, p = 0.5. PPV improved with 7AAB vs 6AAB: 13/83 (16%) vs 12/139 (9%). Among NSCLC cases detected as positive with known stage, 8/14 (57%) were stage I-II. Cancer histology among 61 cases: 46 NSCLC (32 adenocarcinoma, 14 squamous), 4 SCLC, 1 mixed NSCLC+SCLC, and 10 unknown type."
