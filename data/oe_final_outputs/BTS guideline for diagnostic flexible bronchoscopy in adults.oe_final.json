      "abstract": "The British Thoracic Society (BTS) 2013 guideline provides evidence-graded recommendations for the safe performance of diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy in adults. Guidance covers monitoring, sedation and topical anaesthesia, management of complications (hypoxaemia, arrhythmias, bleeding, pneumothorax, fever/infection), use in specific medical conditions (asthma, COPD, ischaemic heart disease, haemoptysis, older adults, immunosuppressed patients), diagnostic sampling strategies for lung cancer, interstitial lung disease and infections, the intensive care setting, and disinfection/decontamination procedures. Recommendations are graded (A-D) with good practice points, emphasizing continuous monitoring, cautious sedation, appropriate sampling to maximize diagnostic yield, and robust decontamination processes.",
      "methods": "This is a clinical practice guideline developed by the BTS Bronchoscopy Guideline Group. Recommendations are based on systematic appraisal of the literature and expert consensus, with evidence graded using the BTS grading system (Grade A-D) and good practice points (âˆš) where evidence is limited but consensus is strong.",
      "results": "The guideline issues specific recommendations across domains: monitoring (vital signs and pulse oximetry), hypoxaemia management (thresholds for supplemental oxygen), arrhythmia risk management, coagulation and antithrombotic management before biopsy, indications for imaging after transbronchial biopsy, fever/infection management (no routine antibiotic prophylaxis), sedation strategies (midazolam preferred; propofol only by trained practitioners; opioid co-sedation considerations), topical anaesthesia with lidocaine (dose minimization and monitoring for toxicity), sampling to optimize diagnostic yield in malignancy and ILD, diagnostic approaches in immunocompromised and immunocompetent hosts with pneumonia/TB, ICU considerations (device sizing, monitoring, NIV/CPAP use), and comprehensive disinfection protocols (AER use, avoidance of aldehydes, tracking and validation)."
