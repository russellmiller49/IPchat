      "abstract": "Flexible bronchoscopy has evolved over the last few decades, allowing chest physicians to use advanced high-definition scopes to inspect the airways and perform various sampling techniques. Although the techniques of basic bronchoscopic sampling have not changed dramatically, documentation requirements, coding, and billing have become more complex and require a better understanding on the part of the proceduralists and practice administrators. Areas in need of attention include learning about the multiple endoscopy rule, appropriate use of modifiers, and recent changes to the Current Procedural Terminology codes, associated work relative value units for moderate sedation, and therapeutic aspiration of secretions. This article describes basic bronchoscopic procedures and the principles needed for their coding and billing.",
      "methods": "Narrative practice management review describing basic bronchoscopy sampling techniques (BAL, TBLB, TBNA, EBB, brushing) and professional billing/coding principles, including CPT code descriptors and associated work RVUs. No formal systematic search, selection criteria, or statistical synthesis were reported.",
      "results": "Key clinical technique summaries: BAL is widely used for cytology and infection workup; minimum instilled volume commonly 100 mL given in 60 mL aliquots, with manual syringe aspiration yielding larger volumes than wall suction but similar diagnostic yield. TBLB can be performed with or without fluoroscopic guidance; complication rates, including pneumothorax, are similar with or without fluoroscopy. Diagnostic yield increases with number of biopsies (approximately 38% for 1-3 vs 69% for 6-10), with 5-7 biopsies often balancing yield and risk. EBB demonstrates sensitivity of 74% for visible central malignant lesions across pooled studies, increasing to as high as 96% when combined with cTBNA. Bronchial brushing has diagnostic rates of 68% in visible central lesions and 41% in peripheral lesions; brushes with bristle diameter < 0.1 mm collect more cells. Safety: basic diagnostic bronchoscopy is generally safe with major complications in < 1% and death rate up to 0.04%. Practice management: detailed CPT coding for diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy procedures, multiple endoscopy rule, modifier use, and decoupling of moderate sedation from bronchoscopy codes are outlined."
