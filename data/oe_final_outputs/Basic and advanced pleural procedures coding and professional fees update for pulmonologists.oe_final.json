      "abstract": "There is an evolution of pleural procedures with broadened clinical indications and expanded scope including advanced diagnostic, therapeutic, and palliative procedures. Finance and clinical professionals face challenges understanding indications and coding complexities. This review describes the utility of pleural procedures, appropriate Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) coding, necessary modifiers, and work relative value units (wRVUs). Coding pearls aim to close knowledge gaps between basic and advanced procedures and reduce payment denials, underpayment, and audit risk.",
      "methods": "Education and Clinical Practice review summarizing pleural procedure indications, technique overviews, and detailed CPT coding guidance with modifiers and wRVUs. No primary patient-level data collection or comparative effectiveness analyses were performed.",
      "results": "Key coding guidance includes: ultrasound chest scan (76604) and ultrasound guidance (75989, append 26 when appropriate); thoracentesis without vs with ultrasound guidance (32554 vs 32555; imaging bundled in 32555); closed pleural biopsy (32400); chest tubes via open thoracostomy (32551) vs percutaneous catheter without vs with imaging (32556 vs 32557; imaging bundled in 32557); indwelling tunneled pleural catheter insertion (32550) and removal (32552); medical thoracoscopy diagnostic without biopsy (32601) vs with pleural biopsy (32609); thoracoscopic pleurodesis (32650), partial pulmonary decortication (32651), and removal of intrapleural foreign body or fibrin deposit (32653) with 90-day global periods; chemical pleurodesis via tube (32560); pleurolysis via fibrinolytic instillation initial day (32561) and subsequent day (32562). The article details global surgical package rules, use of modifiers 25, 51, and 59, and documentation requirements. Clinical context notes include malignant pleural effusion incidence (>150000 cases/year), thoracoscopy-related mortality approximately 0.34%, major complications 1.8%, and low cytology diagnostic rates (26%-32%) for mesothelioma driving need for thoracoscopy."
