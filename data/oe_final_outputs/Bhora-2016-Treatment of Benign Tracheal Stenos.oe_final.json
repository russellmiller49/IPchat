      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Tracheal stenosis is a debilitating disorder with heterogeneity in terms of disease characteristics and management. Repeated recurrences substantially alter patients’ quality of life. There is limited evidence for the use of spray cryotherapy (SCT) in the management of benign airway disease. OBJECTIVE To report our early results for the use of SCT in patients with benign tracheal stenosis. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Data were extracted from the medical records of a consecutive series of patients with benign airway stenosis secondary to granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (n = 13), prior tracheotomy or tracheal intubation (n = 8), and idiopathic strictures (n = 5) treated from September 1, 2013, to September 30, 2015, at a tertiary care hospital. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Airway narrowing was quantified on a standard quartile grading scale. Response to treatment was assessed by improvement in airway caliber and the time interval for reintervention. EXPOSURES Delivery of 4 5-second SCT cycles and 2 balloon dilatations. RESULTS Twenty-six patients (median [range] age, 53 [16-83] years; 20 [77%] female) underwent 48 SCT sessions. Spray cryotherapy was successfully used without any substantial intraoperative or postoperative complications in all patients. In a median (range) follow-up of 11 (1-26) months, all patients had improvement in symptoms. Before the institution of SCT, 23 patients (88%) had grade III or IV stenosis. At the last evaluation after induction of SCT, 4 (15%) had grade III or IV stenosis, with a mean (SD) change of 1.39 (0.51) (P < .001). Patients with GPA required significantly fewer SCT procedures (mean [SD], 1.38 [0.96] vs 2.31 [1.18]; P = .03) during the study period. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Spray cryotherapy was a safe adjunct modality to accomplish airway patency in patients with benign tracheal stenosis. Although efficacy evidence is limited for SCT, it may be useful for patients who have experienced treatment failure with conventional modalities.",
      "methods": "This was a retrospective study of a consecutive series of patients with benign tracheal stenosis treated with spray cryotherapy between September 1, 2013, and September 30, 2015, at a single tertiary care institution. The extent of airway stenosis was graded on a quartile scale (1 = <25%, 2 = 25%-50%, 3 = 51%-75%, 4 = >75%) from endoscopic evaluation before and after therapy, adjudicated by a panel of 4 reviewers. Frequency and time to reintervention between subsequent SCT sessions were recorded and compared with prior modalities. Statistical analyses used paired-sample t tests; P < .05 was considered significant. Procedures were performed under general anesthesia. For upper/mid-tracheal lesions, laryngeal suspension with a Dedo laryngoscope and intermittent apneic oxygenation were used; for distal lesions, endotracheal intubation with at least an 8.5F tube was used. The truFreeze System applied liquid nitrogen spray through a flexible catheter via a therapeutic bronchoscope. Each session used two initial 5-second sprays followed by balloon dilation, then a second identical cycle (total 4 sprays and 2 balloon dilations). Nitrogen gas egress was ensured via passive venting.",
      "results": "Twenty-six patients (median age 53 years; range 16-83; 77% female) underwent 48 SCT sessions. Etiologies included GPA (n = 13), post-tracheotomy or post-intubation (n = 8), and idiopathic strictures (n = 5). Most (96%) had undergone prior endoscopic treatments. Over a median follow-up of 11 months (range 1-26), all patients reported subjective improvement in breathing. Before SCT, 23/26 (88%) had grade III/IV stenosis; after SCT at last follow-up, 4/26 (15%) had grade III/IV stenosis. The mean (SD) change in stenosis grade was 1.39 (0.51) (P < .001). Among 20 patients with ≥6 months follow-up, the mean (SD) intervention rate decreased from 3.78 (3.43) per year before SCT to 1.64 (0.76) per year after SCT (P = .004). Patients with GPA required fewer SCT sessions during the study period than those with traumatic or idiopathic strictures (mean [SD], 1.38 [0.96] vs 2.31 [1.18]; P = .03). There were no substantial intraoperative or postoperative complications; one patient experienced transient intraoperative hypotension."
