      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patients with malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) experience breathlessness and poor survival. Breathlessness is associated with poor survival in other conditions. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is breathlessness, measured using a visual analog scale for dyspnea (VASD), associated with survival in patients with MPE? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Individual patient data from five randomized controlled trials of 553 patients undergoing interventions for MPE were analyzed. VASD was recorded at baseline and daily after intervention. Patients were followed up until death or end of trial. Univariate and multivariable Cox regression were used to identify factors associated with survival. RESULTS: Baseline VASD was significantly associated with worse survival, with a hazard ratio of 1.10 (95% CI, 1.06-1.15) for a 10-mm increase in VASD. On multivariable regression, it remained a significant predictor of survival. Mean 7-day VASD and mean total VASD were also predictors of survival (mean 7-day VASD: HR, 1.26 [95% CI, 1.19-1.34]; total VASD: HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.15-1.37]). Other predictors of survival were serum C-reactive protein level and tumor type. Previous treatment with chemotherapy, performance status, pleural fluid lactate dehydrogenase, serum albumin, hemoglobin, serum neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, and size of effusion were associated with survival on univariate but not multivariable analysis. INTERPRETATION: Breathlessness, measured using VASD at baseline and postprocedure, is a predictor of survival in patients with MPE.",
      "methods": "We conducted a meta-analysis using individual-level data from five RCTs that recruited adults with malignant pleural effusion (MPE) to study the impact of different interventions. All studies measured breathlessness using VASD diaries at baseline (pre-intervention) and for varying durations post-intervention. Analyses used baseline VASD, mean 7-day post-intervention VASD, and mean of all post-intervention VASD (total VASD). Survival was measured from randomization until death; patients alive at end of trial or lost to follow-up were censored. Univariate Cox regression identified predictors of survival. Multivariable Cox models included variables recorded in all trials (sex, age, serum CRP, tumor type, VASD metrics) and were stratified by trial. Nonlinearity in baseline VASD was assessed with cubic splines; baseline VASD was split into thirds for multivariable modeling. Survival time origin differed by analysis: baseline for baseline VASD, day 7 for mean 7-day VASD, and day 84 for total VASD (maximum diary duration).",
      "results": "Of 553 included patients, 311 (56.2%) died during follow-up; median survival was 194 days (95% CI, 160-213). Mean baseline VASD was 45.9 mm (SD 28.8); 113/507 (22%) had VASD <19 mm. A decrease of at least 19 mm in mean 7-day VASD occurred in 194/411 (47.2%); for total VASD, 133/215 (61.9%). Univariate analyses: Baseline VASD (per 10 mm) HR 1.10 (95% CI, 1.06-1.15); mean 7-day VASD (per 10 mm) HR 1.26 (95% CI, 1.19-1.34); total VASD (per 10 mm) HR 1.25 (95% CI, 1.15-1.37). Additional univariate predictors of worse survival included previous chemotherapy, higher ECOG PS, higher PF LDH, higher CRP, higher neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio, smaller effusion size, lower albumin, and lower hemoglobin; tumor type differed with mesothelioma best survival. Multivariable baseline model (n=360; events=204): baseline VASD tertiles associated with survival (67-100 vs 0-33 mm HR 1.73 [95% CI, 1.17-2.54], P=.006), CRP per 10 units HR 1.06 (95% CI, 1.03-1.08, P<.001), tumor type lung vs mesothelioma HR 2.13 (95% CI, 1.36-3.31, P=.001), other vs mesothelioma HR 2.28 (95% CI, 1.43-3.63, P=.001). At 1 week, mean 7-day VASD per 10 mm HR 1.14 (95% CI, 1.06-1.23); CRP HR 1.05 (95% CI, 1.02-1.07). At 84 days, mean total VASD per 10 mm HR 1.19 (95% CI, 1.04-1.37)."
