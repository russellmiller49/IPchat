      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchial thermoplasty is a device-based treatment for subjects ≥ 18 years of age with severe asthma poorly controlled with inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting beta-agonists. The Post-FDA Approval Clinical Trial Evaluating Bronchial Thermoplasty in Severe Persistent Asthma (PAS2) study collected data on patients with severe asthma undergoing this procedure. RESEARCH QUESTION: What are the 5-year efficacy and safety results in patients with severe asthma who have undergone bronchial thermoplasty? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter study conducted in the United States and Canada. Subjects 18 to 65 years of age who were taking inhaled corticosteroids ≥ 1,000 mg/d (beclomethasone or equivalent) and long-acting beta-agonists ≥ 80 mg/d (salmeterol or equivalent) were included. Severe exacerbations, hospitalization, ED visits, and medication usage were evaluated for the 12 months prior to and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. Spirometry was evaluated at baseline and at years 1 through 5 posttreatment. RESULTS: A total of 284 subjects were enrolled at 27 centers; 227 subjects (80%) completed 5 years of follow-up. By year 5 posttreatment, the proportion of subjects with severe exacerbations, ED visits, and hospitalizations was 42.7%, 7.9%, and 4.8%, respectively, compared with 77.8%, 29.4%, and 16.1% in the 12 months prior to treatment. The proportion of subjects on maintenance oral corticosteroids decreased from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Analyses of subgroups based on baseline clinical and biomarker characteristics revealed a statistically significant clinical improvement among all subgroups. INTERPRETATION: Five years after treatment, subjects experienced decreases in severe exacerbations, hospitalizations, ED visits, and corticosteroid exposure. All subgroups demonstrated clinically significant improvement, suggesting that bronchial thermoplasty improves asthma control in different asthma phenotypes.",
      "methods": "PAS2 was a prospective, open-label, observational, multicenter clinical study in the United States and Canada to evaluate 5-year efficacy and safety of bronchial thermoplasty (BT). Eligible adults (18-65 years) had severe asthma inadequately controlled despite high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (≥ 1,000 mg/d beclomethasone or equivalent) and long-acting beta-agonists (≥ 80 mg/d salmeterol or equivalent). Additional asthma therapies (oral corticosteroids and/or omalizumab) were permitted. Subjects with other severe respiratory diseases were excluded. BT was performed using the Alair Bronchial Thermoplasty System per FDA labeling across three procedures. Follow-up consisted of visits 2 weeks after each of the first two BT sessions and 6 weeks after the third, then annual in-person visits for 5 years with interim phone calls every 3 months. Outcomes included proportions of subjects with severe exacerbations, asthma-related ED visits, and hospitalizations during the 12 months prior to BT and at each posttreatment year. Adverse events were collected periprocedurally (day of first BT through 6 weeks after last procedure) and at each follow-up. Statistical analyses used Fisher exact tests for proportions, negative binomial tests for event counts/rates, and t tests for doses. Subgroup analyses used generalized linear models with binomial or negative binomial errors including subgroup, time, and interaction terms; interactions with P < 0.10 were explored with contrasts.",
      "results": "Of 284 enrolled subjects, 279 underwent BT and 227 (81%) completed 5 years of follow-up. Subjects were 64.5% female, mean age 45.7 years, mean BMI 32.2 kg/m2; 95% met ERS/ATS severe asthma criteria. In the 12 months prior to BT, 77.8% (217/279) had ≥1 severe exacerbation, 29.4% (82/279) had ≥1 ED visit, and 16.1% (45/279) had ≥1 hospitalization. Among the 227 subjects followed for 5 years, the proportions with ≥1 severe exacerbation were 50.4%, 46.8%, 47.0%, 44.2%, and 42.7% at years 1 through 5, respectively (P < .001 comparing baseline vs 5 years). Severe exacerbation rate decreased from 1.61 to 0.72 exacerbations/subject (P < .001). ED visit proportions decreased from 29.4% pre-BT to 18.3%, 14.7%, 13.0%, 11.7%, and 7.9% at years 1-5. Hospitalization proportions decreased from 16.1% pre-BT to 9.0%, 7.9%, 5.3%, 4.4%, and 4.8% at years 1-5. Maintenance oral corticosteroid use declined from 19.4% at baseline to 9.7% at 5 years. Subgroup analyses across clinical and biomarker-defined groups showed statistically significant clinical improvement in all subgroups."
