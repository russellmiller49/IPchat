      "abstract": "Background: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube placement is a procedure frequently done in the intensive care unit. The use of a traditional endoscope can be difficult in cases of esophageal stenosis and theoretically confers an increased risk of infection due to its complex architecture. We describe a technique using the bronchoscope, which allows navigation through stenotic esophageal lesions and also minimizes the risk of endoscopy-associated infections. Methods: Prospective series of patients who had PEG tube placement guided by a bronchoscope. Procedural outcomes including successful placement, duration of the entire procedure, time needed for passage of the bronchoscope from the oropharynx to the major curvature, PEG tube removal rate, and mortality were collected. Procedural adverse events, including infections and long-term PEG-related complications, were recorded. Results: A total of 84 patients underwent bronchoscope-guided PEG tube placement. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube insertion was completed successfully in 82 (97.6%) patients. Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy tube placement was performed immediately following percutaneous tracheostomy in 82.1%. Thirty-day mortality and 1-year mortality were 11.9% and 31%, respectively. Overall, minor complications occurred in 2.4% of patients, while there were no major complications. No serious infectious complications were identified and no endoscope-associated hospital acquired infections were documented. Conclusions: The use of the bronchoscope can be safely and effectively used for PEG tube placement. The use of bronchoscope rather than a gastroscope has several advantages, which include the ease of navigating through complex aerodigestive disorders such as strictures and fistulas as well as decreased health-care utilization. In addition, it may have a theoretical advantage of minimizing infections related to complex endoscopes.",
      "methods": "We conducted a review of prospectively collected data from October 2012 until July 2016 of all patients who had flexible bronchoscope-guided PEG tube placement at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (IRB #2012P-000291). Consecutive adult critically ill medical ICU patients who required PEG tube placement and were hemodynamically stable were included. Exclusion criteria: uncorrectable coagulopathy, significant ascites, active peritonitis, esophageal varices, gastric outlet obstruction, and inability to adequately visualize gastrocutaneous transillumination and finger indentation. All patients received preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis per guidelines unless on acceptable antibiotics. Procedures used general IV anesthesia. If combined with percutaneous tracheostomy (PCT), PEG followed tracheostomy using the same bronchoscope. PEG was performed with the pull technique using a 5.9-mm Olympus therapeutic bronchoscope (2.8-mm channel). Oxygen (4-6 L/min) via suction port provided insufflation. Standard transillumination and finger indentation confirmed gastric apposition, followed by percutaneous needle-catheter entry, wire loop snaring, and pull-through placement of a 20F Ponsky Pull PEG tube. Outcomes collected: successful placement, total procedure duration, time from oropharynx to gastric cardia, PEG removal rate, infectious complications, adverse events (CTCAE major/minor), development of sepsis or soft tissue infection, and mortality. Descriptive statistics were used (SPSS v21; significance threshold p<0.05, though no hypothesis tests are reported).",
      "results": "Eighty-four consecutive patients underwent bronchoscope-guided PEG placement. Median age 69 years (IQR 54-77); 64.3% men. Indications included sepsis (35%), prolonged respiratory failure (25%), stroke (16%), neuromuscular disease (7%), ARDS (7%), cardiac arrest (5%), malignancy (5%). Antithrombotic therapy: aspirin 34.5%, prophylactic heparin 46.4%, warfarin with INR>2 1.2%, clopidogrel 1.2%. PEG insertion succeeded in 82/84 (97.6%). Two procedures were aborted due to inadequate transillumination/finger indentation (concern for colonic interposition) and needle not visualized, respectively; both later received laparoscopic PEGs. Median mouth-to-stomach time 1.11 minutes (IQR 0.40-2), and median PEG procedure time 15.42 minutes (IQR 12.36-23.36). Median ICU stay 20 days (IQR 14-29); median hospital stay 24 days (IQR 17-34 reported in Table 2; 13-74 in text). Median follow-up 87 days (IQR 19-459). Thirty-day mortality 11.9% (10/84); 1-year mortality 31% (26/84). Minor complications occurred in 2/84 (2.4%): 1 mild cellulitis at the PEG site and 1 PEG tube malfunction; no major complications (bleeding, perforation, peritonitis, sepsis, aspiration, internal organ injury, death). No serious infectious complications and no endoscope-associated hospital-acquired infections were documented. PEG was performed immediately following PCT in 69/84 (82.1%). PEG was performed bedside in 49/84 (58.3%) and OR in 35/84 (41.7%). PEG removal occurred in 16 patients; median time to removal 152 days (IQR 96-240)."
