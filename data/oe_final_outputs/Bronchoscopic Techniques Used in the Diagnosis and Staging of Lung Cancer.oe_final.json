      "abstract": "With the greater use of chest CT, the incidental detection of lung nodules is expected to increase. However, because most lung nodules are benign, there is a high demand for minimally invasive procedures that provide valuable diagnostic information while minimizing complications. Recent advances in bronchoscopic technology meet this demand. These advanced technologies include navigational bronchoscopy and radial endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for the diagnosis of peripheral lung nodules, and linear EBUS, which has revolutionized the nonoperative nodal staging of lung cancer and provides a complementary option to surgical staging approaches. This article reviews these new bronchoscopic technologies.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of bronchoscopic diagnostic and staging techniques for lung cancer, including navigational bronchoscopy (virtual and electromagnetic), radial EBUS for peripheral lesions, and linear EBUS for mediastinal staging. The review summarizes data from meta-analyses, registries, prospective studies, and a randomized trial comparing endosonography-first versus mediastinoscopy-first staging strategies.",
      "results": "Key findings summarized: CT-guided transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA) shows pooled sensitivity around 90% with individual studies 62%-99, with pneumothorax rates 15%-44. Advanced guided bronchoscopy techniques (navigational bronchoscopy and radial EBUS) demonstrate weighted diagnostic yield about 70.0 with significantly lower pneumothorax risk around 1.5 compared with TTNA. A large multicenter registry reported overall yields of 53.7 for r-EBUS and navigational bronchoscopy in real-world settings. EBUS-TBNA for mediastinal staging shows pooled sensitivity between 88 and 93, comparable to cervical mediastinoscopy (70-92) with similar diagnostic accuracy in a prospective head-to-head cohort (EBUS-TBNA sensitivity 81, NPV 91, accuracy 93; mediastinoscopy sensitivity 79, NPV 90, accuracy 93). In clinical stage I NSCLC with normal mediastinal imaging, occult nodal metastases were present in 9 of 97 patients; EBUS-TBNA detected 8 of these 9 cases. For restaging after induction therapy, EBUS-TBNA showed sensitivity 76, specificity 100, accuracy 77, and low NPV 20, suggesting negative results should be confirmed surgically."
