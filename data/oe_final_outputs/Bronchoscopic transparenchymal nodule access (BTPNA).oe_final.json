      "abstract": "Introduction The promise of benefits from lung cancer screening is tempered by the false positive rate and the need to perform diagnostic procedures to determine the aetiology of the solitary pulmonary nodules (SPN) identified. We have developed a novel procedure which allows sampling of SPNs via a transparenchymal approach, and report the results from this as a first in human trial. Methods This study was a prospective single-arm interventional study. We recruited patients with a SPN detected on CT imaging, which was suspicious for lung cancer, who were suitable for surgical resection. Using the subject’s CT, an optimal airway wall point of entry (POE), and an avascular path through lung tissue from the POE to the SPN was calculated. A tunnel tract was created from the POE to the nodule using a set of catheter-based tools under fused fluoroscopy guidance. The patients proceeded to surgical resection immediately after the biopsy. The participants were followed-up for 6 months after the procedure. The primary endpoint of the study was to evaluate the feasibility to access and biopsy the nodule. Results Twelve patients were recruited, and a tunnel pathway created in 10 patients. There were no adverse events during the procedures. Adequate biopsies were obtained from 10 patients (83%), which correlated with the histological findings from the surgical resection. Inspection of the resected lobes did not raise any safety concerns and indicated appropriately tunnelled pathways to the nodule. Conclusions This first in human study demonstrates that bronchoscopic transparenchymal access of SPNs is feasible. Trial registration number NCT02130115.",
      "methods": "This study was a prospective single-arm interventional study. Patients with a CT-detected solitary pulmonary nodule (SPN) suspicious for lung cancer or metastatic disease, suitable for surgical resection, and with the SPN located ≥10 mm from pleura were enrolled after consent. Planning used the Archimedes Virtual Bronchoscopy Navigation (VBN) System to compute a vessel-free straight path from an airway point of entry (POE) to the SPN and to guide bronchoscopy to the POE. Under general anaesthesia, a coring needle was used to penetrate the airway wall at the POE, the tract was dilated with a balloon, and a blunt stylet-sheathed catheter was advanced under fused CT-fluoroscopy guidance to create a parenchymal tunnel to the SPN for forceps biopsy. A balloon blocker was positioned prophylactically in the lobar bronchus. Immediate post-procedure chest radiograph was performed, followed by surgical resection of the SPN. Intraoperative and ex vivo inspection verified tunnel trajectory. Follow-up at 90 and 180 days assessed adverse events.",
      "results": "Twelve patients (6 men, 6 women; median age 62 years, range 40-72) were enrolled. The BTPNA tunnel pathway was created in 10/12 patients (83%). Adequate histological sampling sufficient for diagnosis was obtained in all 10/10 cases where a tunnel was created, and biopsy histology correlated with surgical pathology in all cases. There were no significant intraprocedural adverse events; post-procedure fluoroscopy showed no pneumothorax. Surgical inspection and specimen examination revealed no localized haemorrhage, bronchial or pulmonary lacerations. One patient had a transient rise in troponin levels post-BTPNA and surgical resection. Outpatient follow-up at 90 and 180 days found no adverse events attributable to the procedure. In 7/12 patients, nodules were not visible on fluoroscopy; the procedure was successfully completed in 6/7 of these cases. The two unsuccessful BTPNA cases involved apical left upper lobe nodules where bronchoscope orientation and vascular proximity precluded a safe straight-line tunnel."
