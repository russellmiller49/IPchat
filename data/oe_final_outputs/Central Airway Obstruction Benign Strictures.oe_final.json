      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to provide an update on methods for palliating symptoms in patients with histologically benign and malignant central airway obstruction. We review the published literature within the past decade on postintubation, posttracheostomy, and TB- and transplant-related airway strictures; tracheobronchomalacia; and malignant airway obstruction. We review terminology, classification systems, and parameters that impact treatment decisions. The focus is on how airway stent insertion fits into the best algorithm of care. Several case series and cohort studies demonstrate that airway stents improve dyspnea, lung function, and quality of life in patients with airway obstruction. Airway stenting, however, is associated with high rates of adverse events and should be used only when curative open surgical interventions are not feasible or are contraindicated.",
      "methods": "Narrative review with literature search described in e-Appendix 1.",
      "results": "The review summarizes classification systems and decision-making parameters for central airway obstruction and benign strictures. Across case series and cohort studies, airway stents improved dyspnea, lung function, and quality of life, but were associated with high adverse event rates. Surgical resection is preferred for most benign strictures; stents are generally reserved for inoperable complex strictures and for palliation in malignant obstruction."
