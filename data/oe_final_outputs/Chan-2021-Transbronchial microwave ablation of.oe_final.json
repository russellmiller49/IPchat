      "abstract": "Background: Microwave ablation of lung nodules may provide a faster, larger and more predictable ablation zone than other energy sources, while bronchoscopic transbronchial ablation has theoretical advantage of fewer pleural-based complications than percutaneous approach. Our study aims to determine whether the novel combination of bronchoscopic approach and microwave ablation in management of lung nodules is technically feasible, safe and effective. Methods: This is a retrospective analysis of a single center experience in electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy microwave ablation in a hybrid operating room. Patients had high surgical risks while lung nodules were either proven malignant or radiologically suspicious. Primary endpoints include technical feasibility and safety. Results: A total of 30 lung nodules from 25 patients were treated. Mean nodule size was 15.1 mm, and bronchus sign was present in 50%. Technical success was 100%, with some nodules requiring double ablation. Mean minimal ablation margin was 5.51 mm. The mean actual ablation zone volume was -21.4% compared to predicted, likely due to tissue contraction ranging 0-43%. No significant heat sink effect was observed. Mean hospital stay was 1.73 days, and only 1 patient stayed >3 days. Complications included pain (13.3%), pneumothorax requiring drainage (6.67%), post-ablation reaction/fever (6.67%), pleural effusion infection (3.33%) and hemoptysis (3.33%). After median follow-up of 12 months, none of the nodules had evidence of progression. Conclusions: Bronchoscopic transbronchial microwave ablation is safe and feasible for malignant lung nodules; prospective studies are warranted.",
      "methods": "Single-centre retrospective analysis of consecutive patients undergoing electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB)-guided transbronchial microwave ablation (MWA) of malignant or radiologically suspicious lung nodules (March 2019-June 2020). Inclusion considered bronchus sign, peripheral location, tumour size <30 mm, and ≥5 mm from large vessels/mediastinum. Patients had biopsy-proven cancer/metastasis or radiologically suspicious nodules if biopsy not feasible/refused. Staging imaging performed; nodal disease ruled out with EBUS if indicated. Procedures were performed in a hybrid OR with cone-beam CT (CBCT) and fluoroscopy. ENB (SuperDimension) guided navigation; CrossCountry tool used for transbronchial access when needed; Emprint microwave catheter used for ablation. Predicted ablation margins were planned (minimum 5 mm). Post-ablation CBCT assessed actual margins; double ablation performed as needed. Follow-up with CT at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months; local control assessed by radiologists using mRECIST. Statistical analyses: descriptive statistics; Student’s t test and chi-square tests as appropriate; significance threshold ≤0.05.",
      "results": "Twenty-five patients (median Charlson comorbidity index 6) with 30 nodules were treated; mean maximal nodule diameter 15.1 mm (range 7-29). Bronchus sign present in 15/30 (50%). Mean procedural time (excluding concomitant biopsy) 126.3 minutes; median CBCT scans per case 7. Double ablation required in 4/30 (13.3%). Technical success was 100% (lesion included in ablation zone with adequate margin). Predicted minimal margin mean 6.63 mm (SD 2.89); actual minimal margin mean 5.51 mm (SD 2.48); no significant difference (P=0.086). Tissue contraction ranged 0-43%; actual ablation zone volume averaged -21.4% (SD 38.9%) vs predicted. Complications (per lesion): pain 4/30 (13.3%, CTCAE 1), pneumothorax requiring chest drain 2/30 (6.67%, CTCAE 3), post-ablation reaction/fever 2/30 (6.67%, CTCAE 1), hemoptysis 1/30 (3.33%, CTCAE 1), infected effusion 1/30 (3.33%, CTCAE 1). No abscess, BPF, hemothorax, arrhythmia, pneumonia, pulmonary edema, airway injury, unintended microwave burn, or procedure-related mortality. Mean hospital stay 1.73 days; one patient stayed 16 days due to pneumothorax with subsequent infected effusion. After median 12 months follow-up, no nodules progressed by mRECIST."
