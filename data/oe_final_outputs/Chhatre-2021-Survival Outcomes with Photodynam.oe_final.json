      "abstract": "Data regarding the association between photodynamic therapy (PDT) and mortality in lung cancer patients are limited. We analyzed the association between PDT and mortality in patients with stage III or IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using data from the National Cancer Database (NCDB) between 2004 and 2016. From the NCDB, we identified patients receiving laser ablation/cryosurgery or local tumor destruction/excision (which includes PDT). From Medicare and Medicaid claims between 2000 and 2013, we identified NSCLC patients receiving PDT and those receiving bronchoscopy, then used these to confirm the PDT treatment. From NCDB, we extracted NSCLC patients who received radiation with chemotherapy, radiation alone or chemotherapy alone. We used survival analysis to determine the association between PDT and mortality. Between 2004 and 2016, 457,556 NSCLC patients with stage III or stage IV were identified, of which 147 received PDT with radiation and chemotherapy, 227,629 received radiation with chemotherapy, 106,667 had radiation therapy alone and 122,193 received chemotherapy alone. Compared to the radiation alone group, the PDT group and radiation with chemotherapy group had lower hazard of mortality (50% and 53% lower, respectively). Among the NSCLC patients with stage III or stage IV disease, the addition of PDT to radiation therapy offers survival benefit over radiation therapy alone.",
      "methods": "Retrospective observational cohort study using the National Cancer Database (NCDB) from 2004-2016 to identify adults with stage III or IV NSCLC who received one of four treatment strategies: (1) PDT as part of ablation/local tumor destruction/excision combined with radiation and chemotherapy; (2) radiation with chemotherapy; (3) radiation alone; or (4) chemotherapy alone. Medicare and Medicaid claims (2000-2013) for PDT and bronchoscopy were used to validate PDT exposure. Demographics, comorbidities (Charlson-Deyo), facility type, insurance, income, geography, stage, and histology were extracted. Propensity score-adjusted Cox proportional hazards models estimated hazard ratios (HRs) for overall mortality comparing treatment groups, adjusting for age, sex, race, insurance, income, urbanicity, Charlson-Deyo score, and stage. Descriptive statistics compared baseline characteristics across groups. Overall mortality proportions and time to death were summarized.",
      "results": "A total of 1,048,113 NSCLC patients were identified; 667,527 had stage III or IV disease. Treatment groups included: PDT + radiation + chemotherapy (n=147), radiation + chemotherapy (n=227,629), radiation alone (n=106,667), and chemotherapy alone (n=122,193). Overall mortality among those with mortality data was 90.8% in the PDT group (118/130), 87.9% in radiation + chemotherapy (183,956/209,390), 95.6% in radiation alone (94,239/98,534), and 91.3% in chemotherapy alone (103,265/denominator not reported). Mean time to death (months) was 18.6 (PDT), 18.0 (radiation + chemotherapy), 7.3 (radiation alone), and 14.7 (chemotherapy alone); overall group differences p<0.0001. In propensity score-adjusted Cox models using radiation alone as reference, PDT + radiation + chemotherapy was associated with lower hazard of mortality (HR=0.50, 95% CI 0.42-0.60), as was radiation + chemotherapy (HR=0.47, 95% CI 0.46-0.50). Using chemotherapy alone as reference, PDT + radiation + chemotherapy had HR=1.03 (95% CI 0.86-1.23) and radiation + chemotherapy had HR=0.98 (95% CI 0.98-1.02)."
