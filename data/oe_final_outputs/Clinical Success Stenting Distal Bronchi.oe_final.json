      "abstract": "Background: Airway stents are traditionally used in central airway obstructions to maintain airway patency. Historically, distal bronchial stenting within lobar and segmental bronchi has not been amenable to stenting. In addition, there are questionable benefits to stenting small airways. The Atrium iCast stent is a polytetrafluoroethylene covered stainless steel balloon deployed stent which can be deployed through a flexible bronchoscope under direct visualization. The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility, complications, and long-term impact of using this stent in patients with lobar bronchial stenosis either secondary to malignancy or benign etiologies. Methods: All records of patients who had the placement of an iCast stent were reviewed over 3.5 years. For each patient the age, sex, location, histology, stent size, duration of stent placement, radiographic improvement, and complications were collected. Results: A total of 122 iCast stents were deployed in 38 patients with lobar bronchial stenosis. The average age was 58 years with 50% male. The etiology included 45% malignant and 55% due to benign conditions. In total, 18.5% patients had stents placed in >1 segment. There was an average of 4 procedures per patient with a mean time to stent revision or removal of 85 days. All patients had symptomatic or radiographic improvement. Common complications included migration (10%), granulation tissue formation (5%), deployment malfunction (2%), stent dislodgement immediately after deployment (2%), mucous plugging (1%), and tumor occlusion (1%). Conclusion: Stenting small airways with lobar salvage is feasible and improves symptoms and radiographic outcomes.",
      "methods": "We retrospectively analyzed medical charts of patients who underwent an iCAST balloon-expandable stent placement at our institution (January 2012 to June 2015). All patients had inoperable lobar bronchial stenosis confirmed by flexible bronchoscopy. Patients initially had balloon bronchoplasty during bronchoscopy to assess for symptomatic improvement and to avoid stent placement; stenting was considered only if they had symptomatic improvement postbronchoplasty and recurrence of bronchial stricture. Patients were classified into 4 groups by etiology (radiotherapy complication, extrinsic compression from primary/metastatic lung carcinoma, lung transplantation complication, and miscellaneous benign conditions). Data collected included demographics, primary diagnosis, location of stenosis, stent size, radiographic findings pre/post stent, procedure or stent-related complications, number of bronchoscopic procedures since stent placement, duration of stent therapy and follow-up. Stenotic airways were dilated with CRE balloon, stent length measured bronchoscopically, and stent diameter chosen 10-15% larger than estimated airway diameter. Stents were deployed under direct visualization through a flexible bronchoscope under general anesthesia, followed by balloon bronchoplasty to attain largest diameter; stent modification performed as needed. Surveillance bronchoscopy occurred 6-12 weeks after the procedure. Outcome was judged successful if the patient experienced symptomatic improvement along with radiographic improvement and/or pulmonary function improvement at first follow-up.",
      "results": "Thirty-eight patients (mean age 58 y; 50% female) underwent placement of 122 iCAST stents. Indications: malignancy 18.5%, radiotherapy-related stenosis 26%, lung transplantation 37%, other benign etiologies 18.5%. Seven patients (18.5%) had stents in >1 segment. There were 148 procedures (average 4 per patient). Most common stent sizes: 7x16 mm (48%), 7x22 mm (32%). Symptomatic improvement was observed in 36/38 (95%). Radiographic evaluation was available for 34/38 (89%); 26/34 (76%) had radiographic improvement. PFT data were available for 16 patients (14 lung transplant recipients); 15/16 (93%) improved with an average FEV1 improvement of 12.3% (range 4%-23%). Overall, 25 complications occurred among 122 stents (20%). Complications: migration 12 (10%), granulation tissue 6 (5%), stent dislodgement postdeployment 3 (2%), deployment malfunction 2 (2%), mucous plugging 1 (1%), tumor occlusion 1 (1%). No deaths were related to stenting. Twenty-two patients had no recorded complications; 16 patients died due to their underlying disease after initial follow-up. Mean time to stent revision/removal was 85 days (range 5-525)."
