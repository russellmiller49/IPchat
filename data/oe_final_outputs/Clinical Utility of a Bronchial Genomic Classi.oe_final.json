      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy is often the initial diagnostic procedure performed in patients with pulmonary lesions suggestive of lung cancer. A bronchial genomic classifier was previously validated to identify patients at low risk for lung cancer after an inconclusive bronchoscopy. In this study, we evaluated the potential of the classifier to reduce invasive procedure utilization in patients with suspected lung cancer. METHODS: In two multicenter trials of patients undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer, the classifier was measured in normal-appearing bronchial epithelial cells from a mainstem bronchus. Among patients with low and intermediate pretest probability of cancer (n = 222), subsequent invasive procedures after an inconclusive bronchoscopy were identified. Estimates of the ability of the classifier to reduce unnecessary procedures were calculated. RESULTS: Of the 222 patients, 188 (85%) had an inconclusive bronchoscopy and follow-up procedure data available for analysis. Seventy-seven (41%) patients underwent an additional 99 invasive procedures, which included surgical lung biopsy in 40 (52%) patients. Benign and malignant diseases were ultimately diagnosed in 62 (81%) and 15 (19%) patients, respectively. Among those undergoing surgical biopsy, 20 (50%) were performed in patients with benign disease. If the classifier had been used to guide decision making, procedures could have been avoided in 50% (21 of 42) of patients undergoing further invasive testing. Further, among 35 patients with an inconclusive index bronchoscopy who were diagnosed with lung cancer, the sensitivity of the classifier was 89%, with 4 (11%) patients having a false-negative classifier result. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive procedures after an inconclusive bronchoscopy occur frequently, and most are performed in patients ultimately diagnosed with benign disease. Using the genomic classifier as an adjunct to bronchoscopy may reduce the frequency and associated morbidity of these invasive procedures.",
      "methods": "Two prospective multicenter observational cohorts (AEGIS-1 and AEGIS-2; 28 centers) enrolled current/former smokers without prior cancer undergoing bronchoscopy for suspected lung cancer. At bronchoscopy, two brushings of normal-appearing mainstem bronchial epithelium were collected and profiled (Affymetrix Gene 1.0 ST arrays). A 23-gene bronchial genomic classifier (Percepta, Veracyte) had been trained/validated previously; clinicians and patients were blinded to classifier results. Pretest probability of cancer was assessed by treating physicians using 5 strata and binned to low (<10%), intermediate (10%-60%), or high (>60%). For this clinical utility analysis, only patients with low or intermediate pretest probability (n = 222) were included. Among those with inconclusive index bronchoscopy, subsequent invasive procedures (repeat bronchoscopy, TTNB, surgical lung biopsy) over 12 months were abstracted. Statistical comparisons used Mann-Whitney U for continuous variables and Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Analyses were conducted in R 3.2.1.",
      "results": "Of 222 low/intermediate-risk patients, 199 (90%) had inconclusive bronchoscopy; follow-up procedure data were available for 188 (94%). In this analyzed cohort, 35 (19%) were ultimately diagnosed with lung cancer and 153 (81%) with benign disease. After inconclusive bronchoscopy, 77/188 (41%) underwent â‰¥1 additional invasive procedure (99 procedures total): surgical lung biopsy in 40/77 (52%), TTNB in 20/77 (26%), and repeat bronchoscopy in 39/77 (51%). Additional invasive procedures were more common in intermediate- vs low-risk patients (62/117 [53%] vs 15/71 [21%]; P < .001). Among those who underwent additional invasive testing, 42/77 (55%) had benign disease (low-risk 13/15 [87%], intermediate-risk 29/62 [47%]). Of 40 surgical lung biopsies, 20 (50%) were in patients with benign disease (low-risk 6/7 [86%], intermediate-risk 14/33 [42%]). Among 35 cancers diagnosed after inconclusive bronchoscopy, 27 (80%) were diagnosed within 3 months and 8 (20%) between 3 and 12 months. Classifier performance in this subset: sensitivity 89% (31/35 positive; 4/35 false-negative). Among benign cases, 83/153 (54%) had a negative classifier result. Hypothetically, if a negative classifier led to surveillance rather than invasive testing, procedures could have been avoided in 21/42 (50%) benign patients who underwent additional invasive testing."
