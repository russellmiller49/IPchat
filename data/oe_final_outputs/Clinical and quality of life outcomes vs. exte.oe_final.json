      "abstract": "Background and purpose: A randomized controlled trial was designed to evaluate the clinical and quality of life (QL) outcomes of patients receiving endobronchial brachytherapy (EBT) or external beam radiotherapy (XRT) as a primary palliative treatment in advanced lung cancer. Materials and methods: Ninety-nine patients presenting de novo with lung cancer were randomized to receive EBT or XRT. Eleven key symptoms or clinical signs were assessed by clinicians and patient ratings using self-assessment questionnaires were obtained at the same time. The primary endpoints were a comparison of EBT and XRT for symptom relief and acute and late side-effects (palliation) and their effect on patients' functional status and patient-rated QL outcomes. A secondary objective was a comparison of clinician assessments with patient self-reported symptoms. Results: Both treatments produced good levels of symptom relief. They were better for XRT at the expense of more acute morbidity. Late side-effects were similar. The functional status of patients was well maintained and changed similarly with time in both groups. XRT gave a better duration of palliation. Twenty-eight percent of XRT patients required EBT (at a median time of 304 days) whereas 51% of EBT patients subsequently had XRT (at a median of 125 days). There was a significant modest gain in median survival with initial XRT (287 vs. 250 days). When clinician and patient assessments were compared, doctors were found to underestimate the severity of breathlessness, anorexia, tiredness and nausea. Conclusions: Fractionated XRT is preferred to EBT as an initial treatment in better performance patients because it provides better overall and more sustained palliation with fewer retreatments and a modest gain in survival time. QL assessment is required in the evaluation of palliative treatments because clinicians frequently underestimate the incidence and severity of key symptoms.",
      "methods": "Randomized, controlled, open-label trial conducted in the UK. The trial opened in July 1989 and closed in July 1993 after recruiting 108 patients with histologically confirmed inoperable NSCLC; 9 with relapse after surgery were excluded from this analysis, leaving 99 previously untreated patients. Patients were randomized to EBT or XRT. EBT: single HDR microSelectron exposure of 15 Gy at 1 cm from the iridium source, treating tumor length plus a 2 cm proximal and distal margin. XRT: 30 Gy delivered in 8 exposures over 10-12 days with parallel-opposed fields to tumor on CXR plus 2 cm margin. Clinician assessments and patient-reported questionnaires were collected at baseline and 4, 8, 16, 26, 38, and 52 weeks, then every 3 months. Primary endpoints: symptom relief, acute and late side effects (palliation), functional status, and patient-rated QL. Secondary: agreement between clinician and patient assessments. Statistical methods included chi-squared tests for contingency tables, Mann-Whitney U-tests for changes from baseline, and survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier; p-value reported).",
      "results": "Both EBT and XRT produced good symptom relief, with trends favoring XRT for most symptoms. At 4 weeks (acute morbidity), clinician-assessed dysphagia favored EBT (85% vs 45% positive end-points; P < 0.001). At 8 weeks, clinician-assessed cough was relieved in 23/46 (50%) with EBT vs 31/46 (67%) with XRT; differences across symptoms favored XRT but were not statistically significant by clinician ratings. Patient-reported outcomes at 8 weeks favored XRT for chest pain (P = 0.003), anorexia (P = 0.003), tiredness (P = 0.0029), and nausea (P = 0.033); by 16 weeks only tiredness remained significant (P = 0.01). XRT provided longer duration of palliation: 25/49 (51%) of EBT patients required subsequent XRT (median 125 days), whereas 14/50 (28%) of XRT patients required subsequent EBT (median 304 days). No serious late morbidity was encountered; massive fatal haemoptysis occurred in 4 EBT and 3 XRT patients, all with local recurrence. Survival favored initial XRT: median 287 vs 250 days; 1-year 38% vs 22%, 2-year 10% vs 2% (P = 0.04). Clinician vs patient comparisons showed clinicians underestimated breathlessness, anorexia, tiredness, and nausea (e.g., breathlessness disagreement P < 0.001)."
