      "abstract": "Introduction/Aim: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) involves the use of a tumor-specific photosensitizer and laser irradiation, and is one of the treatment options recommended for early centrally located lung cancers, but not yet for peripheral-type lung cancers. We developed a new laser probe, the composite-type optical fiberscope (COF), which allows accurate laser irradiation of a cancer lesion with simultaneous visualization of the lesion. In this study, we attempted a new endobronchial PDT technique using the new laser probe, and evaluated the effectiveness and feasibility of this novel PDT technique for peripheral lung cancers. Methods: This phase I study was conducted in 7 patients with peripheral lung cancers (primary tumor ≤20 mm in diameter). We performed endobronchial PDT for these patients using the new laser probe and talaporfin sodium as the photosensitizer. Results: We performed PDT for 3 patients with peripheral lung cancer using a laser dose of 50 J/cm2 at 120 mW, and confirmed the feasibility of using this dose. Then, we escalated the laser dose to 100 J/cm2 in 4 additional patients. A total of 7 patients met our inclusion criteria. Evaluation at 2 weeks and 3 months after the PDT revealed no complication such as pneumonia or pneumothorax. At the evaluation conducted 6 months later, we found CR in 3 cases and SD in the remaining 4 cases. Conclusion: PDT was found to be a feasible and non-invasive treatment modality for early peripheral-type lung cancer. In the future, PDT could become a standard treatment option for peripheral-type lung cancer.",
      "methods": "This was a phase-I, single-arm, multicenter clinical trial at 4 hospitals in Japan (UMIN000021501). Adults ≥20 years with cytologically or histologically confirmed peripheral non-small cell lung cancer, clinical stage IA (7th TNM), lesion ≤20 mm on CT, no nodal or distant metastasis, ECOG PS 0-2, and unsuitable for or declining surgery or radiation therapy were enrolled. Talaporfin sodium (Laserphyrin) 40 mg/m2 was administered intravenously 4-6 hours prior to laser irradiation. Under general anesthesia, a guide sheath was navigated to the lesion using ENB/VBN and R-EBUS. A composite-type optical fiberscope (COF; 1.0 mm OD; 0.4 mm laser fiber; ~10,000 image fibers with 0.5 mm lens) was introduced through the guide sheath for simultaneous visualization and 664 nm diode laser irradiation at 50 J/cm2 or 100 J/cm2 at 150 mW/cm2. If the tumor cross-sectional area exceeded 1.0 cm2, multiple irradiation directions were used. Primary endpoint was the rate of grade ≥2 adverse events within 90 days (CTCAE v4). Secondary endpoints: local progression-free survival (PFS) at 90 days and 1 year, and adverse events up to 1 year. TBLB at 3 months and serial chest CT at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months assessed response and control.",
      "results": "Seven patients (5 men, 2 women; mean age 77.1 years [72-90]; 6 adenocarcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma; average lesion size 16.7 mm [13.6-20]) underwent talaporfin-PDT with the COF. The first 3 patients received 50 J/cm2 and the remaining 4 received 100 J/cm2. Ninety days after PDT, the occurrence rate of grade ≥2 adverse events was 0%. One patient had grade 1 skin photosensitivity; there were no pneumothorax, hemothorax, or pneumonia. At 3 months, 4 patients had CR and 3 had SD; at 6 months, 3 CR and 4 SD; at 1 year, 4 CR and 3 SD. Local-progression-free survival rate at 90 days and 1 year was 100%."
