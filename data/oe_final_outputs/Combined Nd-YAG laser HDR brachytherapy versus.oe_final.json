      "abstract": "Background: Laser debulking and prosthetic stents are useful modalities in the palliative treatment of initial inoperable or recurrent lung cancer. Recently, endobronchial brachytherapy was introduced to extend the duration of palliation and reduce the number of endoscopic treatments. This trial compares Nd-YAG laser alone and associated to high dose rated (HDR)-brachytherapy. Patients and Methods: From 1995 to 1998, 29 consecutive patients, with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and central airway involvement, were randomized in two groups: group 1 (15 patients) received Nd-YAG laser only; group 2 (14 patients) underwent a combined Nd-YAG laser/ HDR brachytherapy treatment. Results: There was no mortality or morbidity related to the treatment. The period free from symptoms was 2.8 months for group 1 and increased to 8.5 months in group 2 (P<0.05). The disease’s progression free period grew from 2.2 months of group 1 to 7.5 months of group 2 (P<0.05) and the number of further endoscopic treatment reduced from 15 to 3 (P<0.05). Conclusion: The results confirm the potential of brachytherapy to prolong relief from symptoms, lessen disease progression and reduce costs of treatment. A detailed analysis is presented of both groups.",
      "methods": "Design: Prospective randomized two-arm study conducted from December 1995 to December 1998. Setting: University of Pisa, Italy. Eligibility: NSCLC with central airway involvement, not eligible for further surgery, chemotherapy, or external beam radiation; expected survival ≥2 months; WHO performance status ≤2. Interventions: Group 1 received Nd-YAG laser debulking alone; Group 2 received Nd-YAG laser debulking followed by HDR endobronchial brachytherapy. Nd-YAG technique: rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia; energy 25-45 W, pulses up to 1.2 s; mean total energy 1850 J (range 1400-2200 J); tangential beams; careful mechanical removal. HDR technique: performed 15-18 days after laser; atropine 1 mg and morphine 10 mg IM premedication, topical lidocaine 2-10%; 1.9 mm (19 French) afterloading catheter (Nucletron) placed via fiberoptic bronchoscope, position verified endoscopically and radiographically; microSelectron-HDR Iridium-192 source (10 Ci), 5 mm step size; prescription 5 Gy at 0.5 cm per fraction, weekly ×3 (total 15 Gy). Assessments: history/PE, pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gases, chest radiograph, bronchoscopy at baseline, 14 days after laser, and 30-45 days after HDR; imaging and bronchoscopic follow-up every 2 months. Airway obstruction scored by Speiser’s method; radiation bronchitis by Gollins’s index. Statistics: Primary endpoint was increase of disease progression-free period from 2 to 8 months; α=0.05 (two-sided), power=90%, planned N=28 (14/arm). Survival by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank. χ2 for median survival; Fisher’s exact test for proportions of events; P<0.05 significant.",
      "results": "Twenty-nine patients were randomized (Group 1 Nd-YAG only n=15; Group 2 Nd-YAG+HDR n=14). Median follow-up was 17.8 months (range 9-35). At analysis, 11 patients were alive; 13 died of local progression and 5 of distant metastases. One Group 2 patient died of massive hemoptysis 12 months post-combination therapy in the setting of local progression. Symptom improvement after laser was observed in 100% with hemoptysis and stridor, 76% with dyspnea, and 48% with cough; symptom-free period was 2.8 months in Group 1 vs 8.5 months in Group 2 (P<0.05). Disease progression-free period was 2.2 months in Group 1 vs 7.5 months in Group 2 (P<0.05). Number of further endoscopic treatments decreased from 15 (Group 1) to 3 (Group 2) (P<0.05). Median survival was 7.4 months (Group 1) vs 10.3 months (Group 2), not significant. Lung function improved after laser in both groups; additional improvements with HDR were not statistically significant. Speiser’s index decreased after laser (e.g., Group 1 from 6.8 to 3.0, P<0.001); HDR led to further, non-significant reduction and complete endoscopic clearance in 8/12 evaluable Group 2 patients, with 7/8 showing histologic clearance. No early treatment-related morbidity or mortality was observed. Late toxicity included actinic (radiation) bronchitis in 6 Group 2 patients (five grade II, one grade III; the latter required bronchoscopic dilatation)."
