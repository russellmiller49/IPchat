      "abstract": "Results of the first 50 consecutive patients referred for bronchoscopy or surgery by the tumor review board to confirm suspect lung lesions identified by computed tomography. Electromagnetic navigation was used to biopsy peripheral pulmonary nodules (19.3 ± 10.7 mm). An electromagnetic tracking system detected miniature position sensors integrated into tip-tracked instruments advanced through a 2 mm working channel in a bronchoscope. Learning curve, diagnostic yield, safety, and use of 4D positional information on the patient’s tidal volume expiration CT map demonstrate potential to improve the diagnostic yield of transbronchial biopsies of peripheral pulmonary nodules less than 30 mm, reporting a diagnostic yield of 83.3% (40/48). Early experience was safe and effective, with a limited learning curve.",
      "methods": "Study design: retrospective chart review of the first 50 consecutive patients (61 lesions) referred by a multidisciplinary hospital tumor review board for diagnostic follow-up of suspect lung lesions on CT. Patients were treated July 2012-May 2013 at a community hospital. Procedures: tidal volume expiration (TV-EXP)-mapped electromagnetic navigation (EMN) bronchoscopy using the SPiNDrive System (Veran Medical Technologies, USA). Flexible bronchoscopy confirmed a clear airway; conscious sedation was used. Linear-EBUS was available as needed. Radial-EBUS, fluoroscopic navigation, and ROSE were not used. Data collected included procedure experience, diagnostic test reports, and follow-up over 24 months. Final diagnosis determined by repeat CT, TTNA, or surgical resection/biopsy as clinically indicated.",
      "results": "Fifty patients (28 males, 22 females; age 31-87 years, mean 67.7 ± 12.2) had 61 lesions biopsied. Mean lesion size was 19.3 ± 10.7 mm (range 4-49 mm). For peripheral pulmonary nodules <30 mm, diagnostic yield was 83.3% (40/48). Early experience was reported as safe and effective with a limited learning curve."
