      "abstract": "Background: Intrabronchial valve placement for endoscopic lung volume reduction is used for patients with severe lung emphysema. Different treatment approaches are unilateral valve placement with the goal of complete occlusion and subsequent atelectasis leading to true volume reduction vs bilateral partial closure aiming for redistribution of ventilation but avoiding atelectasis. In this prospective pilot trial, we compared the efficacy of these treatment approaches. Methods: Patients with severe bilateral heterogeneous emphysema were randomized to two groups. In the first group, patients received unilateral valves aiming for total occlusion of one lobe. In the other group, valves were placed in two contralateral lobes with incomplete closure. In all cases, one-way valves were placed via a flexible bronchoscope. Patients were followed at 30 and 90 days, end points being change in pulmonary function tests (PFTs), 6-min walk distance (6MWD), and dyspnea score as measured by the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea score, as well as quality of life as measured by the St. George Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Results: Twenty-two patients were treated in this study, 11 patients in each arm. At 30 days and 90 days, significant differences were seen in PFT and 6MWD, as well as in mMRC and SGRQ scores, in favor of unilateral treatment. At 90 days, FEV1 was improved by 21.4% ± 10.7% in this group, but not in the bilateral group (-0.03% ± 13.9%, P = .002). One patient in the unilateral group experienced a pneumothorax, and two patients in the bilateral group were treated for transient respiratory failure. Conclusions: Unilateral intrabronchial valve placement with complete occlusion appears superior to bilateral partial occlusion.",
      "methods": "Single-center, prospective, randomized study at the Thoraxklinik, University of Heidelberg. Adults with severe bilateral heterogeneous emphysema were randomized 1:1 (stratified by upper- vs lower-lobe predominance) to unilateral intrabronchial valve (IBV) placement aiming for complete occlusion of one lobe vs bilateral IBV placement in two contralateral lobes with incomplete occlusion (one segment intentionally left open on each side). IBVs from one supplier (Olympus Medical Co) were placed via flexible bronchoscopy. Standard prophylactic antibiotics were given and chest radiograph obtained within 24 h. Follow-up at 30 and 90 days included PFTs, 6MWT, mMRC, SGRQ, chest radiographs, and HRCT at 90 days. Primary endpoints: FEV1 and 6MWD. Secondary endpoints: SGRQ, RV, TLC, IVC, RV/TLC. Safety endpoints: pneumothorax, respiratory failure, death, valve migration. Statistics: SAS 8.2; Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney for between-group comparisons (a = 0.2 as stated), Wilcoxon signed-rank test within groups (a = 0.05); no multiplicity adjustment.",
      "results": "Twenty-two of 73 screened patients were randomized and treated (11 per group); all completed 30- and 90-day follow-up. Baseline characteristics were similar between groups. Mean valves used: unilateral 3.4 (range 3-4), bilateral 5.3 (range 4-11). Unilateral group showed significant improvements at 30 and 90 days in FEV1, IVC, RV/TLC, 6MWD, SGRQ total and impacts domains, and mMRC at 90 days; RV improvement was significant at 90 days only. Bilateral group showed no significant changes in PFTs, 6MWD, SGRQ, or mMRC. At 90 days, FEV1 percent change was 21.4% ± 10.7% (unilateral) vs -0.03% ± 13.9% (bilateral), P = .002. Radiology: Atelectasis at 30 days in 7/11 unilateral vs 0/11 bilateral; at 90 days on HRCT, atelectasis in 5/11 unilateral vs 1/11 bilateral, and visual volume reduction in 9/11 unilateral vs 3/11 bilateral; between-group P = .004 (atelectasis) and P = .030 (volume reduction). Seven unilateral vs one bilateral patient improved ≥30 m in 6MWD by 90 days. Safety: four COPD exacerbations (two per group), one pneumothorax (unilateral, day 4; chest tube; discharged day 16), two respiratory failures (bilateral, days 52 and 76; one required noninvasive ventilation, one intubation; both had valves removed at 90 days). No valve migration or deaths."
