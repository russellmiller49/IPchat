      "abstract": "Background: Therapeutic bronchoscopy is used to palliate malignant central airway obstruction, but practice patterns vary and comparative data on complications across approaches are limited. Methods: Using the CHEST AQuIRE multicenter registry, we evaluated consecutive patients undergoing therapeutic flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. The primary outcome was procedural morbidity (any complication within 24 hours). Secondary outcomes included bleeding, hypoxemia, respiratory failure, adverse events, escalation in level of care, and 30-day mortality. Results: Fifteen centers performed 1,115 procedures on 947 patients. Centers differed in anesthesia type (moderate vs deep/general; p<0.001), use of rigid bronchoscopy (p<0.001), ventilation mode (p<0.001), and stent use (p<0.001). Overall complication rate was 3.9% (44/1,115) with center-level variation (0.9%-11.7%; p=0.002). Risk factors for complications included urgent/emergent procedures, ASA score >3, redo bronchoscopy, and moderate sedation. Six deaths (0.5%) were attributable to procedural complications. Complications with adverse events occurred in 2.2% (24/1,115). Thirty-day mortality after first procedures was 14.8% and varied among centers (7.7%-20.2%; p=0.02). Conclusions: Practice patterns vary substantially and are associated with differences in complications and 30-day mortality.",
      "methods": "Multicenter observational registry study using the CHEST AQuIRE program. Consecutive patients undergoing therapeutic flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction from January 2009 to February 2013 were included. Central airway obstruction was defined as ≥50% occlusion of the trachea, mainstem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or lobar bronchus. Clinical decisions (technique, anesthesia, ventilation, stents) were at the bronchoscopist’s discretion. Outcomes were collected within 24 hours, and 30-day survival was assessed for first procedures. Analyses used chi-square/Fisher/Wilcoxon tests for univariate associations; multivariable hierarchical logistic regression (maximum likelihood or Firth penalized likelihood for rare events) for binary outcomes; ANCOVA for continuous outcomes. Variables with p<0.20 in univariate analyses were candidates for multivariable models; backward selection retained variables with p<0.05. Center-level effects were assessed with hierarchical models.",
      "results": "Fifteen centers and 26 physicians enrolled 947 patients undergoing 1,115 procedures. Anesthesia practices differed (p<0.001), as did use of rigid bronchoscopy (p<0.001), ventilation mode (p<0.001), and stent use (p<0.001). Overall, 44 patients (3.9%) had complications; among centers with ≥25 cases, rates ranged 0.9%-11.7% (p=0.002). Moderate-sedation-predominant centers had higher complication rates (12.2%) than general-anesthesia-predominant centers (3.0%; p<0.001). Escalation in level of care was required in 27/44 (61%) with complications. Six patients (0.5%) died due to procedural complications (4 within 24 hours; 2 after 24 hours but related). Twenty-four patients (2.2%) had a complication with an adverse event; 17/24 (71%) required escalation in care. Thirty-day mortality after first bronchoscopy was 14.8% with center-level variation (7.7%-20.2%; p=0.02). Multivariable analyses found urgent/emergent procedures, ASA >3, redo procedures, and moderate sedation associated with higher complication risk; for complications leading to death, urgent/emergent procedures and never smoking were associated; for complications with adverse events, Zubrod >1, ASA >3, and redo procedures were associated."
