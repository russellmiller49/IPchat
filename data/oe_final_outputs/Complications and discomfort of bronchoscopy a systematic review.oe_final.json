      "abstract": "Objective: To identify bronchoscopy-related complications and discomfort, meaningful complication rates, and predictors. Method: We conducted a systematic literature search in PubMed on 8 February 2016, using a search strategy including the PICO model, on complications and discomfort related to bronchoscopy and related sampling techniques. Results: The search yielded 1,707 hits, of which 45 publications were eligible for full review. Rates of mortality and severe complications were low. Other complications, for instance, hypoxaemia, bleeding, pneumothorax, and fever, were usually not related to patient characteristics or aspects of the procedure, and complication rates showed considerable ranges. Measures of patient discomfort differed considerably, and results were difficult to compare between different study populations. Conclusion: More research on safety aspects of bronchoscopy is needed to conclude on complication rates and patient- and procedure-related predictors of complications and discomfort.",
      "methods": "We used a modified Population-Intervention-Outcome comparison (PICO) form and performed a systematic literature search in PubMed (Medline) on 8 February 2016. Keywords combined MeSH terms and text words related to bronchoscopy procedures and adverse outcomes. We included publications in English, Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, and French. We excluded case reports, non-original research, animal studies, interventional bronchoscopy and specialized techniques, pediatric populations, intubated patients, patients on mechanical ventilation, under general anesthesia or in ICU, and studies not addressing complications or discomfort. Studies on bronchoscopes as contamination sources were excluded. Papers were classified by design (prospective/retrospective), whether complications/discomfort were primary/secondary objectives, and by sample size. Full review was performed for studies with complications/discomfort as primary or secondary objectives, ≥50 subjects, and sufficient description of sample, endpoints, and data collection.",
      "results": "The search identified 1,707 records; 1,435 were excluded. Ninety-four papers reported complications/discomfort as primary/secondary objectives in >50 subjects; after further exclusions, 45 publications were fully reviewed. Mortality was rare (mostly 0% in reported series). Bleeding rates ranged widely (2.5-89.9%) depending on definitions and procedures; one study of 234 low-risk patients reported 0% severe bleeding. Pneumothorax rates after transbronchial biopsies ranged from 0-4%; in a cohort of 1,217 TBBs, 26 pneumothoraces (2.1%) occurred, 14 requiring tube thoracostomy. Bronchospasm occurred in 0-12.3%, highest in asthma cohorts. Hypoxemia definitions varied; desaturation rates ranged 0.7-76.3%. Hemodynamic variations included hypotension (2.9-28.9% depending on sedation regimen), with some requiring fluids; bradycardia was uncommon. Fever incidence post-procedure ranged 2-33% with heterogeneous definitions; in one 50-patient study, 12 developed fever (24%), generally self-limited. Bacteremia occurred in 6.5% of 200 patients without pre-procedural infection. Health care utilization post-bronchoscopy was variably reported (0-31%). Cough was common but variably measured; procedural and post-procedural cough incidences varied widely."
