      "abstract": "Background: Airway guidelines recommend an emergency surgical airway as a potential life-saving treatment in a “Can’t Intubate, Can’t Oxygenate” (CICO) situation. Surgical airways can be achieved either through a cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy. The current literature has limited data regarding complications of cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy in an emergency situation. The objective of this systematic review is to analyze complications following cricothyroidotomy and tracheostomy in airway emergencies. Methods: This synthesis of literature was exempt from ethics approval. Eight databases were searched from inception to October 2018, using a comprehensive search strategy. Studies were included if they were randomized controlled trials or observational studies reporting complications following emergency surgical airway. Complications were classified as minor (evolving to spontaneous remission or not requiring intervention or not persisting chronically), major (requiring intervention or persisting chronically), early (from the start of the procedure up to 7 days) and late (beyond 7 days of the procedure). Results: We retrieved 2659 references from our search criteria. Following the removal of duplicates, title and abstract review, 33 articles were selected for full-text reading. Twenty-one articles were finally included in the systematic review. We found no differences in minor, major or early complications between the two techniques. However, late complications were significantly more frequent in the tracheostomy group [OR (95% CI) 0.21 (0.20-0.22), p < 0.0001]. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that cricothyroidotomies performed in emergent situations resulted in fewer late complications than tracheostomies. This finding supports the recommendations from the latest Difficult Airway Society (DAS) guidelines regarding using cricothyroidotomy as the technique of choice for emergency surgical airway. However, emergency cricothyroidotomies should be converted to tracheostomies in a timely fashion as there is insufficient evidence to suggest that emergency cricothyrotomies are long term airways.",
      "methods": "This systematic review was exempt from ethics approval. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Databases searched from inception to October 2018 included Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, Ovid EBM Reviews - Cochrane Central, PubMed, and EBSCO CINAHL Complete, plus ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP, and ISRCTN. Validated search filters for RCTs and observational studies were applied. Inclusion: RCTs or observational studies reporting complications after emergency cricothyroidotomy or tracheostomy with sufficient detail to classify complications. Exclusion: case reports (<4 patients), studies not separating emergent from urgent procedures, studies combining complications from both techniques, pediatric patients <10 years, and non-clinical (animal/cadaver/mannequin) studies. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (scores 1-8); studies scoring <4 were excluded. Complications were predefined and classified as minor, major, early (≤7 days from procedure start), and late (>7 days). Data extracted included study type, follow-up period, sample sizes, and counts of minor, major, early, and late complications (with late complication denominators reflecting available follow-up). Statistical analysis used chi-square tests for group comparisons and pooled risk ratios via weighted logistic regression (weights proportional to each study’s sample size); p < 0.05 was considered significant.",
      "results": "From 2659 records, 2452 remained after deduplication; 33 full texts were reviewed and 21 studies included (20 observational, 1 RCT). Five studies reported only tracheostomy complications, 14 only cricothyroidotomy, and 2 both. Tracheostomies were all in-hospital (OR, ED, ICU, wards) mainly by surgeons; cricothyroidotomies occurred prehospital and in-hospital, performed by physicians and non-physicians. Follow-up durations varied widely; many studies lacked late follow-up. Across studies, tracheostomy sample size totaled 282 and cricothyroidotomy 725 for early outcomes; late-outcome denominators were smaller due to limited follow-up. There were no statistically significant differences between techniques for minor, major, or early complications. Late complications were significantly less frequent after cricothyroidotomy than tracheostomy with a pooled odds ratio 0.21 (95% CI 0.20-0.22), p < 0.0001."
