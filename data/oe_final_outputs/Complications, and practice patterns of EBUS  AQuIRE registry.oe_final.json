      "abstract": "Background: Few studies of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) have been large enough to identify risk factors for complications. The primary objective of this study was to quantify the incidence of and risk factors for complications in patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA. Methods: Data on prospectively enrolled patients undergoing EBUS-TBNA in the American College of Chest Physicians Quality Improvement Registry, Evaluation, and Education (AQuIRE) database were extracted and analyzed for the incidence, consequences, and predictors of complications. Results: We enrolled 1,317 patients at six hospitals. Complications occurred in 19 patients (1.44%; 95% CI, 0.87%-2.24%). Transbronchial lung biopsy (TBBx) was the only risk factor for complications, which occurred in 3.21% of patients who underwent the procedure and in 1.15% of those who did not (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.07-7.59; P = .04). Pneumothorax occurred in seven patients (0.53%; 95% CI, 0.21%-1.09%). Escalations in level of care occurred in 14 patients (1.06%; 95% CI, 0.58%-1.78%); its risk factors were age > 70 years (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.36-12.12; P = .012), inpatient status (OR, 4.93; 95% CI, 1.30-18.74; P = .019), and undergoing deep sedation or general anesthesia (OR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.02-21.61; P = .048). TBBx was performed in only 12.6% of patients when rapid onsite cytologic evaluation (ROSE) was used and in 19.1% when it was not used (P = .006). Interhospital variation in TBBx use when ROSE was used was significant (P < .001). Conclusions: TBBx was the only risk factor for complications during EBUS-TBNA procedures. ROSE significantly reduced the use of TBBx.",
      "methods": "All patients undergoing bronchoscopy with lymph node sampling by TBNA at six centers from February 13, 2009, to August 31, 2010, were entered consecutively into AQuIRE at the time of their procedure. Institutional review board approval was obtained at each site. Data were entered through the AQuIRE Web-based interface using standardized definitions, quality control checks, and protocols. Information included demographics, clinical characteristics, physician and hospital information, sedation, procedure details, pathology results, complications, and outcomes of complications. The use of ROSE was recorded, but only the final pathology reading was entered. The primary outcome was procedural morbidity within 24 h (bleeding requiring intervention, pneumothorax, clinically significant airway injury, sustained hypoxia, hypotension, cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, or respiratory failure requiring positive pressure ventilation). Secondary outcomes included escalation in level of care (hospital admission for outpatients or ICU transfer for inpatients), need for further interventions, and death. Categorical data were compared using Fisher exact test, stratified analysis used the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test, and logistic regression examined associations between outcomes and characteristics. Hierarchical models (patients nested within hospitals) were compared with ordinary logistic regression by removing the hospital variance component. Variables with P ≤ .20 on univariate analysis were candidates for multivariate models; backward elimination retained factors with P < .05. Analyses used SAS 9.1.",
      "results": "A total of 1,317 patients were enrolled by 12 physicians from six hospitals. Any complication within 24 h occurred in 19 patients (1.44%; 95% CI, 0.87%-2.24%); one patient died after bleeding following endobronchial biopsy. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that TBBx was associated with increased risk of any complication: 3.21% with TBBx vs 1.15% without (OR, 2.85; 95% CI, 1.07-7.59; P = .04). There was a trend toward higher complications with worse functional status (Zubrod ≥2: 2.5% vs <2: 1.04%; OR, 2.42; 95% CI, 0.97-6.02; P = .06). Pneumothorax occurred in 7 patients (0.53%; 95% CI, 0.21%-1.09%); 4 required tube thoracostomy and 3 resolved without intervention. Only TBBx was associated with increased risk of pneumothorax (2.7% with TBBx vs 0.2% without; OR, 15.49; 95% CI, 2.98-80.46; P = .001). Among the 187 TBBx patients, use of positive pressure ventilation was not associated with pneumothorax (2.0% vs 2.9%; P = 1.0). Escalation in level of care occurred in 14 patients (1.06%; 95% CI, 0.58%-1.78%). In multivariate analysis, age >70 years (OR, 4.06; 95% CI, 1.36-12.12; P = .012), inpatient status (OR, 4.93; 95% CI, 1.30-18.74; P = .019), and deep sedation/general anesthesia (OR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.02-21.61; P = .048) were associated with increased risk of escalation. Tests for homogeneity demonstrated no differences among hospitals in complications (P = .99) or escalation of care (P = .77); hospital volume was not associated with outcomes. ROSE use was associated with less TBBx (12.6% vs 19.1%; P = .006), with significant interhospital variation (P < .001)."
