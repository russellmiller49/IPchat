      "abstract": "Rationale: Treatment of pleural infection with intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and human recombinant DNase (DNase) decreases length of stay, surgical referral, and improves drainage. Optimal dosing and whether drugs can be given immediately one after the other (concurrent) are unclear. Objectives: Assess safety and efficacy of concurrent intrapleural tPA/DNase guided by clinical and radiographic response in pleural infection. Methods: Retrospective cohort of consecutive patients receiving concurrent tPA/DNase. Initiation and number of doses were based on drainage, clinical response, and imaging. Results: Seventy-three patients received concurrent tPA/DNase; treatment was successful in 90.4%. Most (80.8%) were effectively treated with fewer than six doses (median 2; IQR 1-3.5). First dose within 24 hours of chest tube insertion in 71.2%. Median hospital stay from first dose to discharge was 7 days (IQR 5-11). Pleural fluid drained increased from median 295 ml (IQR 97.5-520) 24 hours before treatment to 1,102 ml (IQR 627-2,200) at 72 hours after therapy (P<0.001). Nonfatal pleural bleeding occurred in 5.4%, chest pain in 15.1%, and mortality due to pleural infection was 2.7%. Conclusions: Early concurrent tPA/DNase appears relatively safe and effective; therapy can be guided by clinical and radiographic response.",
      "methods": "Retrospective cohort at a single center (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center). Consecutive patients with pleural infection (complicated parapneumonic effusion [CPPE] or empyema) receiving concurrent intrapleural tPA/DNase between January 2010 and October 2015 were included. CPPE defined by clinical infection and pleural fluid pH ≤7.2, glucose <60 mg/dl, LDH >1,000 IU/L, and/or loculations. Empyema defined as pus and/or positive Gram stain/culture. Chest tubes placed under ultrasound guidance. tPA 10 mg and DNase 5 mg, each in 50 ml 0.9% NaCl, administered intrapleurally one after the other (not mixed), followed by 60-ml saline flush, tube clamped for 120 minutes, then suction. Dosed twice daily up to six doses. Initiation and dosing guided by drainage (<200 ml/24 h), ultrasound/CT evidence of septations, and clinical response. Outcomes included treatment success (clinical/radiographic improvement without surgery), adverse events (pleural bleeding requiring transfusion or causing hemodynamic instability; significant pain requiring escalation of analgesia), change in CT effusion volume, need for surgery, mortality due to pleural infection, pleural fluid drainage volumes, length of stay, chest tube duration, number of fibrinolytic doses, and chest tube characteristics. Statistics: nonparametric summaries; Wilcoxon signed-rank test for paired pre/post comparisons; significance at P<0.05.",
      "results": "Seventy-three patients (mean age 59.3 years; 70% male) received concurrent tPA/DNase. Small-bore chest tubes were used in 91.8%. Ultrasound showed loculations in 76.7%. Purulent fluid in 30.1%; positive Gram stain/culture in 26.0%. Treatment success without surgery in 66/73 (90.4%); 7/73 (9.6%) required surgery. Most patients (59/73; 80.8%) responded with fewer than six doses (median doses 2; IQR 1-3.5). First dose within 24 hours of tube insertion in 52/73 (71.2%). Pleural fluid drained increased from median 295 ml (IQR 97.5-520) 24 hours before therapy to 1,102 ml (IQR 627-2,200) 72 hours after therapy (P<0.001). CT effusion volume reduced from median 361 ml (IQR 239-677) to 80 ml (IQR 37.2-154.3) (P<0.001). In-hospital mortality due to pleural infection was 2/73 (2.7%). Pleural bleeding requiring transfusion occurred in 4/73 (5.4%); chest pain requiring opioid escalation in 11/73 (15.1%). Median chest tube duration 5 days (IQR 4-8); time from insertion to first tPA/DNase dose 1 day (IQR 0-2). Median total hospital stay 11 days (IQR 7-15); from first dose to discharge 7 days (IQR 5-11)."
