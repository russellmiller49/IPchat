      "abstract": "Background: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a minimally invasive technology for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules. However, ENB is limited by the lack of real-time confirmation of various biopsy devices. Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) could increase diagnostic yield by allowing real-time confirmation to overcome the inherent divergence of nodule location. Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the diagnostic yield of ENB plus CBCT as compared with ENB alone for biopsy of peripheral lung nodules. Method: We conducted a retrospective study of patients undergoing ENB before and after the implementation of CBCT. Data from 62 consecutive patients with lung nodules located in the outer two-thirds of the lung who underwent ENB and combined ENB-CBCT were collected. Radial endobronchial ultrasound was used during all procedures as well. Diagnostic yield was defined as the presence of malignancy or benign histological findings that lead to a specific diagnosis. Results: Thirty-one patients had ENB-CBCT, and 31 patients had only ENB for peripheral lung lesions. The median size of the lesion for the ENB-CBCT group was 16 (interquartile range (IQR) 12.6-25.5) mm as compared to 21.5 (IQR 16-27) mm in the ENB group (p = 0.2). In the univariate analysis, the diagnostic yield of ENB-CBCT was 74.2% and ENB 51.6% (p = 0.05). Following multivariate regression analysis adjusting for the size of the lesion, distance from the pleura, and presence of bronchus sign, the odds ratio for the diagnostic yield was 3.4 (95% CI 1.03-11.26, p = 0.04) in the ENB-CBCT group as compared with ENB alone. The median time for the procedure was shorter in patients in the ENB-CBCT group (74 min) than in those in the ENB group (90 min) (p = 0.02). The rate of adverse events was similar in both groups (6.5%, p = 0.7). Conclusions: The use of CBCT might increase the diagnostic yield in ENB-guided peripheral lung nodule biopsies. Future randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm such findings.",
      "methods": "We conducted a retrospective study of patients undergoing ENB before and after the introduction of CBCT to assess the diagnostic yield. Data from 62 consecutive patients with lung nodules <3 cm located in the outer two-thirds of the lung who underwent ENB-guided lung biopsy from December 1, 2018, to October 1, 2019, were collected. Patients were assigned to ENB-only or ENB-CBCT groups based on procedure timing relative to CBCT implementation (May 2019). All procedures used the iLogic 7.0 ENB platform with a steerable catheter and standard locatable guide. In the ENB-CBCT group, CBCT imaging (Artis Zeego; DynaCT protocol: 8 s rotation, 200° gantry rotation, 0.5°/projection, 396 projections, detector dose 0.36 μGy/frame) enabled manual segmentation and augmented fluoroscopy (Syngo iGuide Toolbox) for real-time needle-in-lesion confirmation. Radial-probe EBUS was used in both groups. All procedures were under general anesthesia with mechanical ventilation and an inspiratory breath-hold at 20 cm H2O during imaging. Tissue sampling used multimodality tools (cytology brush, FNA, forceps, targeted BAL). Diagnostic yield was defined as a specific malignant or benign diagnosis; normal lung parenchyma, atypical cells, or nonspecific inflammation were considered nondiagnostic. Statistical analyses included t or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for continuous variables, χ2 tests for dichotomous variables, and a stepwise multivariate regression model including target size, distance to pleura, bronchus sign, and diagnostic yield.",
      "results": "Thirty-one patients underwent ENB-CBCT and 31 underwent ENB-only. Median lesion size was 16 mm (IQR 12.6-25.5) in ENB-CBCT vs 21.5 mm (IQR 16-27) in ENB (p = 0.2). Median distance from pleura was 8 mm (IQR 0-20) vs 19 mm (IQR 0-28) (p = 0.3). Bronchus sign was present in 58.1% vs 41.9% (p = 0.20). Diagnostic yield was 74.2% (23/31) for ENB-CBCT vs 51.6% (16/31) for ENB (p = 0.05). Adjusted odds ratio for diagnostic yield with ENB-CBCT vs ENB was 3.4 (95% CI 1.03-11.26; p = 0.04). Median bronchoscopy time was 74 min (IQR 61-87) vs 90 min (IQR 72-119) (p = 0.02). Pneumothorax occurred in 2 patients in each group (6.5%). Overall adverse event rates were similar (6.5% in each group; p = 0.7). Target visibility with fluoroscopy was 25.8% vs 41.9% (p = 0.06). Nine ENB-CBCT patients required a second CBCT; none had more than two."
