      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Whether conservative management is an acceptable alternative to interventional management for uncomplicated, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax is unknown. METHODS: In this open-label, multicenter, noninferiority trial, we recruited patients 14 to 50 years of age with a first-known, unilateral, moderate-to-large primary spontaneous pneumothorax. Patients were randomly assigned to immediate interventional management of the pneumothorax (intervention group) or a conservative observational approach (conservative-management group) and were followed for 12 months. The primary outcome was lung reexpansion within 8 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 316 patients underwent randomization (154 patients to the intervention group and 162 to the conservative-management group). In the conservative-management group, 25 patients (15.4%) underwent interventions to manage the pneumothorax, for reasons prespecified in the protocol, and 137 (84.6%) did not undergo interventions. In a complete-case analysis in which data were not available for 23 patients in the intervention group and 37 in the conservative-management group, reexpansion within 8 weeks occurred in 129 of 131 patients (98.5%) with interventional management and in 118 of 125 (94.4%) with conservative management (risk difference, -4.1 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], -8.6 to 0.5; P=0.02 for noninferiority). In a sensitivity analysis in which all missing data after 56 days were imputed as treatment failure (with reexpansion in 129 of 138 patients [93.5%] in the intervention group and in 118 of 143 [82.5%] in the conservative-management group), the risk difference of -11.0 percentage points (95% CI, -18.4 to -3.5) was outside the prespecified noninferiority margin. Conservative management resulted in a lower risk of serious adverse events or pneumothorax recurrence than interventional management. CONCLUSIONS: Although the primary outcome was not statistically robust to conservative assumptions about missing data, the trial provides modest evidence that conservative management of primary spontaneous pneumothorax was noninferior to interventional management, with a lower risk of serious adverse events.",
      "methods": "Multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, noninferiority RCT at 39 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Eligible patients were 14-50 years old with first-known, unilateral primary spontaneous pneumothorax of 32% or more on chest radiograph by Collins method (sum of interpleural distances >6 cm). Patients were randomized 1:1 via centralized web-based urn randomization stratified by site to interventional management (small-bore ≤12 Fr Seldinger chest tube to underwater seal, no suction) or conservative management (observation with protocolized criteria for rescue intervention). Follow-up at 24-72 hours, and at 2, 4, and 8 weeks (radiography if unresolved), with 6- and 12-month recurrence assessment by phone and records. Primary outcome: complete radiographic resolution by 8 weeks as assessed by treating physician; visits after 56 days were treated as missing unless later imaging showed persisting pneumothorax (failure). Sensitivity analyses extended the window to 63 days and, separately, imputed post-day-56 missing as failure. Secondary outcomes included per-protocol primary outcome, blinded radiologist review, time to radiographic resolution, time to symptom resolution, recurrence, adverse events, serious adverse events, hospital length of stay, procedures and imaging counts, work days lost, persistent air leak (≥72 hours drainage), and patient satisfaction. Primary analysis used logistic regression of complete cases at 8 weeks to estimate absolute risk difference and 95% CI with a binomial noninferiority test (margin -9 percentage points).",
      "results": "316 patients were randomized (154 interventional; 162 conservative). In the conservative group, 25/162 (15.4%) underwent protocol-defined interventions; 137/162 (84.6%) did not. Ten interventional-assigned patients (6.5%) declined intervention and were managed conservatively. For the primary complete-case analysis (8-week window capped at 56 days), resolution occurred in 129/131 (98.5%) interventional vs 118/125 (94.4%) conservative (risk difference -4.1 percentage points; 95% CI -8.6 to 0.5; P=0.02 for noninferiority). Sensitivity extending to 63 days: 134/136 (98.5%) vs 129/136 (94.9%) (risk difference -3.7; 95% CI -7.9 to 0.6). Sensitivity imputing post-day-56 missing as failure: 129/138 (93.5%) vs 118/143 (82.5%) (risk difference -11.0; 95% CI -18.4 to -3.5). Time to radiographic resolution: median 16 days (IQR 12-26) interventional vs 30 days (IQR 25-54) conservative; hazard ratio 0.49 (95% CI 0.39-0.63). Per-protocol analysis: 124/126 (98.4%) interventional vs 123/130 (94.6%) conservative (risk difference -3.8; 95% CI -8.3 to 0.7). Conservative management led to fewer serious adverse events and recurrences than interventional management."
