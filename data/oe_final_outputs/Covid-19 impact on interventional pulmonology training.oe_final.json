      "abstract": "Background: The impact of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic extends beyond the realms of patient care and healthcare resource use to include medical education; however, the repercussions of COVID-19 on the quality of training and trainee perceptions have yet to be explored. Objective: The purpose of this study was to determine the degree of interventional pulmonology (IP) fellows’ involvement in the care of COVID-19 and its impact on fellows’ clinical education, procedure skills, and postgraduation employment search. Methods: An internet-based survey was validated and distributed among IP fellows in North American fellowship training programs. Results: Of 40 eligible fellows, 38 (95%) completed the survey. A majority of fellows (76%) reported involvement in the care of patients with COVID-19. Fellows training in the Northeast United States reported involvement in the care of a higher number of patients with COVID-19 than in other regions (median, 30 [interquartile range, 20-50] vs. 10 [5-13], respectively; P < 0.01). Fifty-two percent of fellows reported redeployment outside IP during COVID-19, mostly into intensive care units. IP procedure volume decreased by 21% during COVID-19 compared with pre-COVID-19 volume. This decrease was mainly accounted for by a reduction in bronchoscopies. A majority of fellows (82%) reported retainment of outpatient clinics during COVID-19 with the transition from face-to-face to telehealth-predominant format. Continuation of academic and research activities during COVID-19 was reported by 86% and 82% of fellows, respectively. After graduation, all fellows reported having secured employment positions. Conclusion: Although IP fellows were extensively involved in the care of patients with COVID-19, most IP programs retained educational activities through the COVID-19 outbreak. The impact of the decrease in procedure volume on trainee competency would be best addressed individually within each training program. These data may assist in focusing efforts regarding the education of medical trainees during the current and future healthcare crises.",
      "methods": "The study was approved by the Memorial Sloan Kettering Institutional Review Board (X20-025) and endorsed by the AABIP and the AIPPD. Physicians actively training in a North American accredited IP fellowship program for the academic year 2019-2020 were eligible. Fellows were contacted via e-mail to complete a 99-item online survey (REDCap) administered March 22-April 3, 2020. Items covered demographics, COVID-19 exposure, PPE access, redeployment, procedure volumes before (from fellowship start through March 15, 2020; converted to median monthly) and during COVID-19 (March 16-April 15, 2020), outpatient clinic, academic, and research activities, and employment search. Geographical comparisons contrasted Northeast U.S. (CT, MA, NJ, NY, PA) vs other regions. Descriptive statistics were used; paired t test compared procedure volumes pre vs during COVID-19; Wilcoxon rank-sum or Student’s t test and Chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests were used for between-group comparisons. Two-sided P < 0.05 was significant. Analyses used SAS 9.4.",
      "results": "Of 40 eligible fellows, 38 (95%) completed the survey. Involvement in COVID-19 care was reported by 29/38 (76%). Fellows cared for a median 27 (IQR 10-35) COVID-19 patients over a representative 30 days, higher in Northeast programs vs other regions (30 [20-50] vs 10 [5-13]; P < 0.01). Among exposed fellows, 19/29 (65%) participated in tracheostomies and 17/29 (58%) in bronchoscopies; the median number performed on COVID-19 patients was 4 (IQR 1-9) tracheostomies and 5 (IQR 2-15) bronchoscopies. Northeast fellows reported more tracheostomies on COVID-19 patients than others (5 [4-15] vs 1 [1-4]; P = 0.01). Satisfaction with PPE access was 37/38 (97%), and 33/38 (87%) reported access to stress management; 5/38 (13%) self-quarantined due to exposure or infection. Overall procedure volume decreased by 21% during COVID-19 vs pre-COVID-19 (P < 0.01). Specific decreases were observed for linear EBUS (-27%), guided bronchoscopies (-39%), and therapeutic bronchoscopies (-31%) (P ≤ 0.01 for each). Outpatient management was part of training for 35/38 (92%); of these, 29/35 (82.9%) continued clinic activity during COVID-19, with 27/35 (77%) reporting decreased activity and 6/35 (17%) reporting cancellation. The main clinic format shifted from face-to-face 37/38 (97%) pre-COVID-19 to 6/38 (17%) during COVID-19 (P < 0.01); telemedicine involvement increased from 1/38 (3%) to 25/38 (66%) (P < 0.01). Educational curricula were present in 30/38 (79%); of these, activities continued for 26/30 (86%). Lecture formats shifted from face-to-face 23/30 (76%) to 3/30 (10%) (P < 0.01); teleconferencing increased from 6/30 (20%) to 26/30 (86%) (P < 0.01). Dedicated research time was included for 11/38 (29%); among these, 9/11 (82%) had unchanged/increased research time and 2/11 (18%) decreased. Redeployment outside IP was planned or pursued for 20/38 (52%); 6/20 (30%) were already redeployed, spending a median 60 (IQR 40-96) weekday and 10 (IQR 0-24) weekend hours in redeployment roles; 9/20 (45%) were voluntary and 11/20 (55%) mandatory. At the time of the survey, 29/38 (76%) had secured positions; by follow-up in November 2020, all fellows had secured employment."
