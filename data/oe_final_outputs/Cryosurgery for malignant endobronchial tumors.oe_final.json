      "abstract": "Study objectives: The majority of lung cancer patients are unsuitable for curative surgery and often require palliation for symptoms caused by airway obstruction. This study analyzes the effects of endobronchial cryosurgery on obstructive endobronchial carcinoma. Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospective database. Setting: Tertiary thoracic surgical center. Patients: 329 patients with malignant primary or metastatic obstructive lung carcinoma treated over 5 years were grouped by treatment exposure: group A (n=172) had at least two cryosurgery sessions; group B (n=157) had one session. Intervention: Endobronchial cryosurgery under general anesthesia with a nitrous oxide cryoprobe applied to the tumor for two 3-min freezes per session. Measurements and results: Dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis were significantly reduced within groups after cryosurgery (p<0.001). Group A showed significant improvements in lung function (PEF and FVC) and higher Karnofsky scores. Mean survival was 15 months (median 11) in group A vs 8.3 months (median 6) in group B (log-rank p=0.006). Thirty-day mortality was 2/172 (1.1%) in group A vs 17/157 (10.8%) in group B (p=0.0002). In univariate analyses, cryosurgery combined with external beam radiotherapy was associated with longer survival (p<0.01). Female sex was associated with greater improvements in Karnofsky score (p<0.02), FEV1 (p=0.003), and FVC (p<0.001). Conclusions: Endobronchial cryosurgery is a safe palliative option for obstructive endobronchial malignancies, improving symptoms, selected lung function parameters, performance status, and survival.",
      "methods": "Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data (1996-2000) from a single tertiary thoracic center. Population: Consecutive patients with symptomatic obstructive endobronchial malignant tumors, largely inoperable due to advanced stage or poor functional status. Grouping: Group A (≥2 cryosurgery sessions; n=172) vs Group B (1 session; n=157). Intervention: Rigid bronchoscopy under short-acting IV general anesthesia with Venturi positive pressure ventilation; Joule-Thomson nitrous oxide cryoprobe achieving approximately -70°C at the tip; tumor frozen for 3 minutes per application, two applications per session; sessions typically spaced 2-6 weeks apart. Bleeding controlled with topical epinephrine 1:1,000; necrotic tissue removed as needed. Assessments: Symptoms (NYHA dyspnea class; graded cough and hemoptysis), lung function (PEF, FEV1, FVC), Karnofsky performance score, tumor histology and stage, adjuvant therapy, and survival. Follow-up typically at 2 weeks after each session and serially thereafter. Statistical analysis: Within-patient before/after comparisons by Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests; categorical comparisons by Fisher exact or chi-square tests; continuous data by t test or Mann-Whitney U test as appropriate; survival by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank test; associations by univariate Cox regression (survival) and ordered logistic regression (other outcomes), followed by multivariate models. Significance threshold p≤0.05.",
      "results": "Patients: 329 total (group A n=172; group B n=157), similar in sex, age, histology, and stage distribution, though group A received more radiotherapy. Most tumors were squamous; 67% (group A) and 77% (group B) were stage IIIb or IV at presentation. Adjuvant treatments in group A: radiotherapy 101/172 (57.7%), lung resection 12/172 (7.0%), chemotherapy 20/172 (11.6%); radiotherapy was less frequent in group B (45/157; 28.6%). Symptoms: In group A at first follow-up, dyspnea improved by ≥1 class in 87/172 (50.5%), cough improved in 88/172 (51.1%), and hemoptysis improved in 36/172 (20.9%). Reductions in dyspnea, cough, and hemoptysis were statistically significant within groups (p≤0.001). Lung function: In group A, PEF increased from 170±79 to 181±73 L (p=0.03) and FVC from 1.89±0.63 to 2.02±0.72 L (p=0.001) at first follow-up; FEV1 rose from 1.36±0.63 to 1.43±0.47 L (not significant). Karnofsky performance: Mean increased from 67±9 to 74±10 in group A, and from 67±10 to 73±11 in group B. Survival: Mean survival 15 months (median 11) in group A vs 8.3 months (median 6) in group B; log-rank p=0.006. Complications: No bronchial perforation. Immediate postoperative complications included bleeding (6/172 vs 8/157), new-onset atrial fibrillation (3/172 vs 6/157), and respiratory distress (4/172 vs 8/157). Thirty-day mortality was 2/172 vs 17/157 (p=0.0002)."
