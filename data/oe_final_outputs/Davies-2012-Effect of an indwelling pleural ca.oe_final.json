      "abstract": "Context Malignant pleural effusion causes disabling dyspnea in patients with a short life expectancy. Palliation is achieved by fluid drainage, but the most effective first-line method has not been determined. Objective To determine whether indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) are more effective than chest tube and talc slurry pleurodesis (talc) at relieving dyspnea. Design Unblinded randomized controlled trial (Second Therapeutic Intervention in Malignant Effusion Trial [TIME2]) comparing IPC and talc (1:1) for which 106 patients with malignant pleural effusion who had not previously undergone pleurodesis were recruited from 143 patients who were treated at 7 UK hospitals. Patients were screened from April 2007-February 2011 and were followed up for a year. Intervention Indwelling pleural catheters were inserted on an outpatient basis, followed by initial large volume drainage, education, and subsequent home drainage. The talc group were admitted for chest tube insertion and talc for slurry pleurodesis. Main Outcome Measure Patients completed daily 100-mm line visual analog scale (VAS) of dyspnea over 42 days after undergoing the intervention (0 mm represents no dyspnea and 100 mm represents maximum dyspnea; 10 mm represents minimum clinically significant difference). Mean difference was analyzed using a mixed-effects linear regression model adjusted for minimization variables. Results Dyspnea improved in both groups, with no significant difference in the first 42 days with a mean VAS dyspnea score of 24.7 in the IPC group (95% CI, 19.3-30.1 mm) and 24.4 mm (95% CI, 19.4-29.4 mm) in the talc group, with a difference of 0.16 mm (95% CI, -6.82 to 7.15; P=.96). There was a statistically significant improvement in dyspnea in the IPC group at 6 months, with a mean difference in VAS score between the IPC group and the talc group of -14.0 mm (95% CI, -25.2 to -2.8 mm; P=.01). Length of initial hospitalization was significantly shorter in the IPC group with a median of 0 days (interquartile range [IQR], 0-1 day) and 4 days (IQR, 2-6 days) for the talc group, with a difference of -3.5 days (95% CI, -4.8 to -1.5 days; P<.001). There was no significant difference in quality of life. Twelve patients (22%) in the talc group required further pleural procedures compared with 3 (6%) in the IPC group (odds ratio [OR], 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-0.86; P=.03). Twenty-one of the 52 patients in the catheter group experienced adverse events vs 7 of 54 in the talc group (OR, 4.70; 95% CI, 1.75-12.60; P=.002). Conclusion Among patients with malignant pleural effusion and no previous pleurodesis, there was no significant difference between IPCs and talc pleurodesis at relieving patient-reported dyspnea.",
      "methods": "Open-label randomized controlled trial at 7 UK centers (April 2007-February 2011). Adults with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion requiring pleurodesis were randomized 1:1 to indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) vs chest tube with talc slurry pleurodesis (talc). Randomization used minimization (80% random component) via central telephone service, balancing on histology (mesothelioma vs non-mesothelioma) and WHO performance status (0/1 vs 2/3). IPCs were inserted typically as outpatient procedures with initial large-volume drainage and subsequent home drainage 3 times weekly or as needed. IPC removal was planned after ≥4 weeks of minimal drainage without radiographic reaccumulation. Talc arm received inpatient 12F chest tube insertion and 4 g sterile talc slurry pleurodesis per British Thoracic Society guidelines; trapped lung precluded pleurodesis but patients remained in follow-up. Follow-up to 12 months. Patients completed daily 100-mm VAS for dyspnea and chest pain for 42 days and at scheduled later time points; EORTC QLQ-C30 quality of life, complications, and health care use were assessed periodically. Primary outcome: mean daily dyspnea over first 42 days (100-mm VAS). Secondary outcomes: proportion with ≥10-mm clinically significant dyspnea improvement over 42 days; VAS dyspnea at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months; mean daily chest pain over 42 days and at those time points; length of initial hospital stay; all-cause mortality up to 1 year; global QOL (EORTC QLQ-C30); serious and nonserious adverse events. Analyses were intention-to-treat including all randomized with available outcomes, adjusted for minimization variables. Mixed-effects linear regression modeled repeated VAS with fractional polynomials for time and random effect for study day; baseline VAS included (mean imputation for missing baseline). Sensitivity analyses used multiple imputation under MAR and MNAR.",
      "results": "106 patients randomized: 52 to IPC, 54 to talc. Baseline characteristics were generally balanced. For the primary outcome, 3 IPC and 7 talc patients had no recorded VAS and were excluded from VAS analyses; deaths within 42 days (5 IPC, 15 talc) were included. Median observed VAS days was 41 in both groups. No significant difference in mean dyspnea over 42 days: IPC 24.7 mm (95% CI, 19.3-30.1) vs talc 24.4 mm (95% CI, 19.4-29.4); difference 0.16 mm (95% CI, -6.82 to 7.15; P=.96). Both groups improved from baseline (IPC -37.0 mm; talc -30.2 mm). At 6 months, dyspnea was significantly better with IPC (mean difference -14.0 mm; 95% CI, -25.2 to -2.8; P=.01). Chest pain decreased modestly in both groups over 42 days with no between-group difference. Initial hospitalization was shorter with IPC: median 0 days (IQR 0-1) vs 4 days (IQR 2-6); difference -3.5 days (95% CI, -4.8 to -1.5; P<.001). Further ipsilateral pleural procedures were required in 12/54 (22%) talc vs 3/52 (6%) IPC (OR 0.21; 95% CI, 0.04-0.86; P=.03). Patients with ≥1 adverse event: 21/52 (40%) IPC vs 7/54 (13%) talc (OR 4.70; 95% CI, 1.75-12.60; P=.002). Quality of life showed no significant differences."
