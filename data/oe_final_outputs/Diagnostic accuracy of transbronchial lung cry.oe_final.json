      "abstract": "Background Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is a novel technique for sampling lung tissue for interstitial lung disease diagnosis. The aim of this study was to establish the diagnostic accuracy of TBLC compared with surgical lung biopsy (SLB), in the context of increasing use of TBLC in clinical practice as a less invasive biopsy technique. Methods COLDICE was a prospective, multicentre, diagnostic accuracy study investigating diagnostic agreement between TBLC and SLB, across nine Australian tertiary hospitals. Patients with interstitial lung disease aged between 18 and 80 years were eligible for inclusion if they required histopathological evaluation to aid diagnosis, after detailed baseline evaluation. After screening at a centralised multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), patients with interstitial lung disease referred for lung biopsy underwent sequential TBLC and SLB under one anaesthetic. Each tissue sample was assigned a number between 1 and 130, allocated in a computer-generated random sequence. Encoded biopsy samples were then analysed by masked pathologists. At subsequent MDD, de-identified cases were discussed twice with either TBLC or SLB along with clinical and radiological data, in random non-consecutive order. Co-primary endpoints were agreement of histopathological features in TBLC and SLB for patterns of definite or probable usual interstitial pneumonia, indeterminate for usual interstitial pneumonia, and alternative diagnosis; and for agreement of consensus clinical diagnosis using TBLC and SLB at MDD. Concordance and κ values were calculated for each primary endpoint. This study is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12615000718549. Findings Between March 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019, we enrolled 65 patients (31 [48%] men, 34 [52%] women; mean age 66.1 years [SD 9.3]; forced vital capacity 83.7% [SD 14.2]; diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide 63.4% [SD 12.8]). TBLC (7.1 mm, SD 1.9) and SLB (46.5 mm, 14.9) samples were each taken from two separate ipsilateral lobes. Histopathological agreement between TBLC and SLB was 70.8% (weighted κ 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.86); diagnostic agreement at MDD was 76.9% (κ 0.62, 0.47-0.78). For TBLC with high or definite diagnostic confidence at MDD (39 [60%] of 65 cases), 37 (95%) were concordant with SLB diagnoses. In the 26 (40%) of 65 cases with low-confidence or unclassifiable TBLC diagnoses, SLB reclassified six (23%) to alternative high-confidence or definite MDD diagnoses. Mild-moderate airway bleeding occurred in 14 (22%) patients due to TBLC. The 90-day mortality was 2% (one of 65 patients), following acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Interpretation High levels of agreement between TBLC and SLB for both histopathological interpretation and MDD diagnoses were shown. The TBLC MDD diagnoses made with high confidence were particularly reliable, showing excellent concordance with SLB MDD diagnoses. These data support the clinical utility of TBLC in interstitial lung disease diagnostic algorithms. Further studies investigating the safety profile of TBLC are needed.",
      "methods": "The COLDICE study was a comparative, multicentre, prospective, investigator-initiated, diagnostic accuracy study done across nine Australian tertiary hospitals with interventional pulmonology and interstitial lung disease expertise. Eligible patients were aged between 18 and 80 years, required lung biopsy to support their interstitial lung disease diagnosis after detailed baseline evaluation and centralised multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), could provide informed consent, and had no contraindications for lung biopsy. Patients underwent sequential TBLC and SLB under a single general anaesthetic. TBLC used a 1.9 mm or 2.4 mm cryoprobe under fluoroscopic guidance to obtain 4-7 samples from two ipsilateral lobes with prophylactic endobronchial balloon blockers; bleeding severity and pneumothorax were assessed post-procedure. SLB via video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery obtained two biopsies from the same lobes. Pathology slides for all 130 samples (65 TBLC, 65 SLB) were de-identified and randomly coded; three masked expert pathologists provided individual and consensus interpretations of guideline-directed histopathological categories and specific ILD patterns, with confidence levels recorded. De-identified cases were presented twice at MDD (once with TBLC histopathology and once with SLB histopathology) along with identical clinical and HRCT data in random non-consecutive order; participants recorded provisional and final consensus diagnoses with confidence levels, with biopsy type masked by concealing specimen dimensions. Co-primary endpoints were agreement of histopathological categories between TBLC and SLB and agreement of MDD consensus diagnosis between TBLC-based and SLB-based discussions. Concordance and κ statistics (weighted for histopathological categories) were calculated.",
      "results": "Sixty-five patients were enrolled between March 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019 (mean age 66.1 years, SD 9.3; 31 men [48%]; FVC 83.7% predicted, SD 14.2; DLCO 63.4% predicted, SD 12.8). TBLC specimens had mean diameter 7.1 mm (SD 1.9) and SLB specimens 46.5 mm (SD 14.9), each from two ipsilateral lobes. Histopathological agreement between TBLC and SLB was 70.8% with weighted κ 0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.86). MDD diagnostic agreement between TBLC-based and SLB-based discussions was 76.9% with κ 0.62 (95% CI 0.47-0.78). Among 39 cases (60%) with high or definite diagnostic confidence at MDD using TBLC, 37 (95%) were concordant with SLB-based diagnoses. Among 26 cases (40%) with low-confidence or unclassifiable TBLC diagnoses, SLB reclassified 6 (23%) to alternative high-confidence or definite MDD diagnoses. Mild-moderate airway bleeding occurred in 14 patients (22%) attributable to TBLC. Ninety-day mortality was 1 of 65 patients (2%), following acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."
