      "abstract": "Study objective—To demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and appropriate mode of instillation of talc for sclerosis in treatment of malignant pleural effusions (MPEs). Design—A prospective, randomized trial was designed to compare thoracoscopy with talc insufflation (TTI) to thoracostomy and talc slurry (TS) for patients with documented MPE. Measurements—The primary end point was 30-day freedom from radiographic MPE recurrence among surviving patients whose lungs initially re-expanded > 90%. Morbidity, mortality, and quality of life were also assessed. Results—Of 501 patients registered, those eligible were randomized to TTI (n = 242) or TS (n = 240). Patient demographics and primary malignancies were similar between study arms. Overall, there was no difference between study arms in the percentage of patients with successful 30-day outcomes (TTI, 78%; TS, 71%). However, the subgroup of patients with primary lung or breast cancer had higher success with TTI than with TS (82% vs 67%). Common morbidity included fever, dyspnea, and pain. Treatment-related mortality occurred in nine TTI patients and seven TS patients. Respiratory complications were more common following TTI than TS (14% vs 6%). Respiratory failure was observed in 4% of TS patients and 8% of TTI patients, accounting for five toxic deaths and six toxic deaths, respectively. Quality-of-life measurement demonstrated less fatigue with TTI than TS. Patient ratings of comfort and safety were also higher for TTI, but there were no differences on perceived value or convenience of the procedures. Conclusions—Both methods of talc delivery are similar in efficacy; TTI may be better for patients with either a lung or breast primary. The etiology and incidence of respiratory complications from talc need further exploration.",
      "methods": "This was an intergroup cooperative trial led by CALGB with participation by RTOG, ECOG, and NCCTG. Credentialing of participating surgeons was required. Institutional review board approval and written informed patient consent were obtained. Eligibility criteria included a history of malignancy, pleural effusion requiring sclerosis, ECOG/Zubrod status 0-2, life expectancy > 2 months, and ability to undergo general anesthesia. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy, previous intrapleural therapy or radiation therapy encompassing the entire hemithorax, changes in systemic therapy within 2 weeks prior to randomization or subsequent to sclerosis (except addition of tamoxifen), and chylous or bilateral effusions requiring therapy. Patients were randomized to receive 4 to 5 g of talc as a slurry in 100 mL saline solution through a chest tube at the bedside (TS) or insufflated during thoracoscopy in the operating room (TTI). After drainage of the pleural fluid, lung re-expansion by > 90% as estimated by the surgeon was required to proceed on protocol. TS patients underwent sclerosis within 24 to 36 h of chest tube placement. The chest tube was clamped for 2 h then reattached to suction. Chest tube(s) were removed once 24-h drainage was < 150 mL, and a baseline chest radiograph (CXR) was obtained. Additional CXRs were obtained at 30 days and then monthly until death or for 6 months. Primary endpoint was 30-day freedom from radiographic MPE recurrence among surviving patients whose lungs initially re-expanded > 90%, assessed by surgeon evaluation comparing 30-day CXR with baseline. Success rates were compared using Fisher exact test. Secondary endpoints included time to recurrence (log-rank), frequency of complications/toxicities (Fisher exact test), and lung re-expansion by CXR (Fisher exact test). Pain intensity (VAS) and satisfaction (Likert scales) were compared by Wilcoxon tests. QLQ-C30 change at 30 days was analyzed by ANCOVA.",
      "results": "Between January 1995 and September 1999, 501 patients were randomized (TS, n = 250; TTI, n = 251). Nineteen were excluded (13 ineligible, 6 withdrew), leaving 240 TS and 242 TTI for analysis. The > 90% lung re-expansion criterion was met by 163/240 TS (68%) and 177/242 TTI (73%) [p = 0.231]. Among these, 33/163 TS (20%) and 25/177 TTI (14%) died within 30 days. Overall successful 30-day outcomes showed no difference (TTI, 78%; TS, 71%). Among all treated patients with > 90% lung re-expansion, successful pleurodesis at 30 days favored TTI (67%) vs TS (56%) [p = 0.045], while among those alive at 30 days, success did not differ. In the lung or breast cancer subgroup with > 90% re-expansion and alive at 30 days, success was 82% for TTI vs 67% for TS (p = 0.022). Of 271 eligible patients alive at 30 days without recurrence, 214 (TS, n = 103; TTI, n = 111) contributed follow-up; 60 late recurrences occurred (TS, 23/103 [22%]; TTI, 37/111 [33%]); time-to-recurrence did not differ (log-rank p = 0.622). Independent radiologic review in 102 per arm showed stable/improved radiology at 30 days in 70% (TS) vs 76% (TTI). Respiratory complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, or respiratory failure) occurred more often after TTI (13.5%) vs TS (5.6%) [p = 0.007]. Grade ≥3 toxicity occurred in 26% (TS) and 32% (TTI). Treatment-related deaths: TS, 7 (respiratory failure 5, cardiac 2); TTI, 9 (respiratory 6, cardiac 1, infection 2). QOL: TTI had less fatigue at 30 days vs TS (p = 0.016). Patient perceptions favored TTI for comfort (p = 0.019) and medical safety (p = 0.013)."
