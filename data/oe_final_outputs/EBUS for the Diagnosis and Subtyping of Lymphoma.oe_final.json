      "abstract": "Background: Excisional biopsies are typically used to diagnose lymphoma, but data suggest that endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is equally effective. In this study, we determined whether EBUS-TBNA could accurately diagnose and subtype lymphoma. Methods: The cases of patients who had undergone EBUS-TBNA for suspected lymphoma were retrospectively reviewed. EBUS-TBNA results were categorized as lymphoma, specific nonlymphoma diagnosis, granulomatous inflammation, or adequate or inadequate lymphocytes with no specific diagnosis. To quantify the ability of EBUS-TBNA to diagnose lymphoma, we used likelihood ratios. To quantify the ability of EBUS-TBNA to diagnose and subtype lymphoma, we calculated sensitivity and specificity. For this analysis, lymphoma that could be subtyped on the basis of EBUS-TBNA was classified as a true positive; lymphoma that could not be subtyped was classified as a false negative. Results: Of the 181 patients included, 75 (41.5%) were ultimately diagnosed with lymphoma. EBUS-TBNA was able to establish a diagnosis of lymphoma in 63 patients (84%). Granulomatous inflammation diagnosed on the basis of EBUS-TBNA was associated with a low likelihood of lymphoma being present (likelihood ratio, 0.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00-0.276). Adequate lymphocytes were associated with a low likelihood of lymphoma (LR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.14-0.49). EBUS-TBNA was able to establish a diagnosis and subtype the lymphoma in 67% (95% CI, 0.45-0.88) of patients with de novo lymphoma and 81% (95% CI, 0.70-0.91) of patients with relapsed lymphoma. Conclusions: EBUS-TBNA is an effective, minimally invasive diagnostic test for patients with suspected lymphoma and can provide valuable clinical information, even with “negative” results.",
      "methods": "We performed a retrospective review of all EBUS-TBNA cases from January 2007 to March 2014 at our institution (IRB PA14-0320). Adults (≥18 years) with isolated intrathoracic adenopathy suspected of lymphoma were included. We excluded patients with known sarcoidosis, mycobacterial or fungal infections, lung masses suspicious for primary lung cancer, and nonlymphoma malignancies within the prior 5 years with chest metastases. EBUS-TBNA results were classified as: (1) lymphoma that could be subtyped; (2) lymphoma that could not be subtyped; (3) specific nonlymphoma diagnosis; (4) granulomatous inflammation without a specific diagnosis; (5) adequate lymphocytes but no specific diagnosis; (6) inadequate lymphocytes with no specific diagnosis. Final diagnoses were adjudicated by a multidisciplinary team using clinical, pathologic, microbiologic, and radiologic data with ≥6 months follow-up. Diagnostic performance to identify lymphoma was evaluated using likelihood ratios across multi-category EBUS results. The ability to diagnose and subtype lymphoma was summarized by sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV; for this analysis, only EBUS-TBNA results that allowed subtyping were considered true positives; lymphoma detected without subtyping was counted as negative. Statistical analyses used chi-square or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and Kruskal-Wallis for continuous variables; two-sided alpha 0.05; SAS v9.3.",
      "results": "Among 4,070 consecutive EBUS-TBNA cases, 181 had suspected lymphoma (111 suspected relapse; 70 suspected de novo). Final diagnoses included 75 lymphoma (21 Hodgkin lymphoma; 54 non-Hodgkin lymphoma [36 low grade; 18 high grade]) and 106 nonlymphoma. A total of 369 lymph nodes and 19 mediastinal masses were sampled (median 2 nodes/patient; median 5 passes/node). For lymphoma diagnosis, EBUS-TBNA was diagnostic in 63/75 (84%). Likelihood ratios (lymphoma present vs absent) by EBUS category: lymphoma result LR ∞ (95% CI 11.192, ∞); granulomatous inflammation LR 0.00 (95% CI 0.00-0.276); specific nonlymphoma diagnosis LR 0.00 (95% CI 0.00-0.982); adequate or inadequate lymphocytes LR 0.31 (95% CI 0.181-0.545). For diagnosing and subtyping, EBUS-TBNA correctly identified and subtyped lymphoma in 58/75; sensitivity 0.77 (95% CI 0.68-0.87) and specificity 1.00 (95% CI 1.00-1.00); PPV 1.00; NPV 0.86 (95% CI 0.80-0.92). Sensitivity was 0.67 (95% CI 0.45-0.88) in suspected de novo (TP 12, FN 6) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.70-0.91) in suspected relapsed (TP 46, FN 11); difference not significant (P = 0.33). False-negative rates by subtype were 24% in HL, 22% in high-grade NHL, and 8% in low-grade NHL (P = 0.19)."
