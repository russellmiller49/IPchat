      "abstract": "Background: Clopidogrel is widely used for the prevention of thrombotic vascular complications. Its primary potential toxicity is bleeding. Management of clopidogrel therapy for patients undergoing invasive procedures is an area of ongoing study. We sought to evaluate the bleeding risk for patients undergoing needle aspiration biopsy by endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) or esophageal ultrasound (EUS) while taking clopidogrel. Methods: Retrospective review of sequential cases of endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) and esophageal ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). Results: Three hundred ninety-five consecutive procedures were reviewed. Thirty-seven patients were taking clopidogrel at time of biopsy. The patients taking clopidogrel were significantly older than those in the control group. Two patients (1%) in the control group were admitted for observation, but neither was found to have a significant bleed. There were no clinically significant bleeding complications in either of the study groups. Conclusions: It is reasonable to proceed with EBUS-TBNA or EUS-FNA when both, (1) clopidogrel cannot be stopped and, (2) an important diagnostic question is at stake.",
      "methods": "Retrospective chart review at a single institution (University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences; protocol #204048) of consecutive EBUS-TBNA and EUS-FNA procedures performed between July 31, 2014 and June 30, 2015. Procedures were conducted under conscious sedation with physician-administered propofol. Patients were supine with head elevation ≈30 degrees, no repositioning, and all procedures performed orally through a bite block without endotracheal intubation or laryngeal mask airway. A convex curvilinear bronchoscope (Olympus UC180F) and a 22-G needle (Olympus) were used. Doppler was not used during sampling. Suction was routinely applied. Rapid on-site cytologic examination (ROSE) was available. Data collected: age, sex, procedure type, number of sites biopsied, antiplatelet/anticoagulant use, procedure-related bleeding, pre/post hemoglobin (when available), required interventions, and additional procedures during the same sedation. Patients on clopidogrel who held it >4 days were placed in the control group. Patients on aspirin only were not included in the antiplatelet group. Significant bleeding was defined as a hemoglobin drop ≥2 g/dL or any acute/delayed bleeding requiring observation or intervention. All consecutive EBUS-TBNA and/or EUS-FNA procedures in the interval were included. Analyses were performed using SPSS.",
      "results": "A total of 395 procedures were reviewed (198 EBUS-TBNA; 197 EUS-FNA), including 78 combined procedures (categorized by the first procedure performed). Pre- and postprocedure hemoglobin values were available for 211 procedures. Thirty-seven patients continued clopidogrel periprocedurally (20 EUS-FNA; 17 EBUS-TBNA); 358 patients had no antiplatelet therapy and served as controls. Among clopidogrel patients, 31/37 had drug-eluting stents placed 16 ± 8 days prior; 6/37 had stents placed 91 ± 27 days prior. No other antiplatelet agents (excluding aspirin) were used. Patients on clopidogrel were older (69 ± 23 vs 58 ± 18 years; P < 0.0001). Additional procedures were more frequent in controls (7/37 [19%] vs 87/358 [24%]; P < 0.0002). Across controls, 951 sites were sampled; 17 (1.7%) were inadequate at ROSE but all were adequate after cell block. In the clopidogrel group, 83 sites were sampled; 1 (1.2%) was inadequate at ROSE but adequate after cell block. Needle passes per site were 3.87 ± 2.78 (clopidogrel) vs 5.12 ± 3.96 (control; P = 0.078). Overall in the clopidogrel group, 46/83 sites (55%) were malignant. There were no significant bleeding events in either group. Two complications occurred in controls: (1) suspected mediastinal bleeding on ultrasound after EBUS-TBNA leading to observation and CT angiography without evidence of active bleeding; pre/post hemoglobin 11.2 to 10.3 g/dL, discharged the next morning; (2) right pleural effusion presenting 3 days post EBUS-TBNA of 11R requiring chest tube; blood-tinged exudate; not hemothorax; no transfusion. No complications occurred in the clopidogrel group (P = 0.652)."
