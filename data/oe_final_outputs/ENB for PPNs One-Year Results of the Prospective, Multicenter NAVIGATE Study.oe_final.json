      "abstract": "Introduction: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a minimally invasive technology that guides endoscopic tools to pulmonary lesions. ENB has been evaluated primarily in small, single-center studies; thus, the diagnostic yield in a generalizable setting is unknown. Methods: NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter, cohort study that evaluated ENB using the superDimension navigation system (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). In this United States cohort analysis, 1215 consecutive subjects were enrolled at 29 academic and community sites from April 2015 to August 2016. Results: The median lesion size was 20.0 mm. Fluoroscopy was used in 91% of cases (lesions visible in 60%) and radial endobronchial ultrasound in 57%. The median ENB planning time was 5 minutes; the ENB-specific procedure time was 25 minutes. Among 1157 subjects undergoing ENB-guided biopsy, 94% (1092 of 1157) had navigation completed and tissue obtained. Follow-up was completed in 99% of subjects at 1 month and 80% at 12 months. The 12-month diagnostic yield was 73%. Pathology results of the ENB-aided tissue samples showed malignancy in 44% (484 of 1092). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for malignancy were 69%, 100%, 100%, and 56%, respectively. ENB-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 or higher pneumothoraces (requiring admission or chest tube placement) occurred in 2.9%. The ENB-related Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events grade 2 or higher bronchopulmonary hemorrhage and grade 4 or higher respiratory failure rates were 1.5% and 0.7%, respectively. Conclusions: NAVIGATE shows that an ENB-aided diagnosis can be obtained in approximately three-quarters of evaluable patients across a generalizable cohort based on prospective 12-month follow-up in a pragmatic setting with a low procedural complication rate.",
      "methods": "NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter, global, single-arm, pragmatic cohort study of ENB using the superDimension navigation system, version 6.0 or higher (Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota). Consecutive adult subjects presenting with a lung lesion requiring evaluation and who were candidates for an elective ENB procedure according to physician judgment were enrolled. There were no protocol-specified restrictions on procedural technique, complementary tools, or imaging; these were subject to the clinician’s discretion, but were prospectively captured. Biopsy tools included aspirating needles, biopsy forceps, cytology brushes, needle-tipped cytology brushes, the superDimension triple-needle cytology brush, the GenCut core biopsy system, and bronchoalveolar lavage. Lymph node staging by linear endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) could occur before, during, or after the index procedure. A maximum of 75 subjects per site was allowed. Twenty-four-month follow-up was pre-specified. The primary endpoint was ENB-related pneumothorax requiring intervention or hospitalization (CTCAE grade ≥2). For 12-month diagnostic endpoints, ENB-aided pathology that was nonmalignant or indeterminate was considered negative; follow-up established true-negative (nonmalignant diagnosis or no progression) versus false-negative (malignancy on follow-up, lesion growth with appropriate follow-up diagnostics, death due to lung cancer within 12 months, treatment without confirmed diagnosis, or new diagnoses of lung cancer from any site). Twelve-month diagnostic yield was calculated as (true-positives + true-negatives) among all attempted lung lesion biopsies, including subjects with unsuccessful navigation; negative cases without sufficient information were deferred to 24 months and included in sensitivity analyses. Analyses used descriptive statistics and logistic regression to explore predictors.",
      "results": "In the U.S. cohort, 1215 subjects were enrolled at 29 sites (April 2015-August 2016). ENB aided in lung lesion biopsy (n=1157), fiducial placement (n=258), pleural dye marking (n=3), and/or lymph node biopsy (n=30). Follow-up was completed in 98.9% at 1 month and 80.3% at 12 months. Median lesion size was 20 mm. Fluoroscopy was used in 91.0% (lesions visible in 60%), radial EBUS in 57.4%, and cone-beam CT in 4.9%. Navigation was successful with tissue obtained in 94.4% (1092/1157). ENB-aided biopsy diagnosed malignancy in 44.3% (484/1092) and was negative in 55.7% (608/1092). At 12 months, among initially negative cases, 284 were true-negative and 220 were false-negative; 104 negative cases were deferred to 24-month analysis. Twelve-month diagnostic yield was 72.9%, calculated as (484+284)/1053, where the denominator includes all attempted biopsy cases excluding the 104 deferred and includes subjects with unsuccessful navigation. Sensitivity for malignancy and NPV were 68.8% and 56.3%, respectively; ranges accounting for deferred cases were 59.9%-68.8% for sensitivity and 46.7%-63.8% for NPV. ENB-related CTCAE grade ≥2 pneumothorax occurred in 2.9% (35/1215). Bronchopulmonary hemorrhage occurred in 2.5% overall and 1.5% grade ≥2 (counts not reported). Grade ≥4 respiratory failure occurred in 0.7% (count not reported). There were 233 deaths within 12 months; one anesthesia-related death due to grade 5 hypoxic respiratory failure occurred 9 days post-ENB; no deaths were related to the ENB device or associated tools."
