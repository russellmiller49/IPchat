      "abstract": "This ERS/ATS Task Force position paper defines interventional pulmonology and outlines minimal requirements for facilities, personnel, preprocedure evaluation, monitoring, indications, contraindications, outcomes, complications, and training for major diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopic and thoracic interventions.",
      "methods": "Consensus statement developed by a multidisciplinary ERS/ATS Task Force of European and North American experts. Recommendations are based on expert experience and literature review; no randomized controlled trial design or statistical analyses were conducted.",
      "results": "The statement details equipment, personnel, anaesthesia, techniques, indications, contraindications, outcomes/complications, and training requirements for: rigid bronchoscopy; transbronchial needle aspiration; autofluorescence bronchoscopy; endobronchial ultrasound; transthoracic needle aspiration/biopsy; laser bronchoscopy; endobronchial electrosurgery and argon-plasma coagulation; cryotherapy; airway stents; endobronchial brachytherapy; photodynamic therapy; percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy; and transtracheal oxygen therapy. It also discusses multimodality treatment and outcome assessment. Examples include training thresholds (e.g., at least 20 supervised rigid bronchoscopies, then 10-15 per year to maintain competency) and qualitative descriptions of complications (e.g., mucosal and airway wall injuries with rigid bronchoscopy)."
