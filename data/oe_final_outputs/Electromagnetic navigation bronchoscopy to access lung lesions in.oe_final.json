      "abstract": "Background: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is an image-guided, minimally invasive approach that uses a flexible catheter to access pulmonary lesions. Methods: NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter study of the superDimension navigation system. A prespecified 1-month interim analysis of the first 1,000 primary cohort subjects enrolled at 29 sites in the United States and Europe is described. Enrollment and 24-month follow-up are ongoing. Results: ENB index procedures were conducted for lung lesion biopsy (n = 964), fiducial marker placement (n = 210), pleural dye marking (n = 17), and/or lymph node biopsy (n = 334; primarily endobronchial ultrasound-guided). Lesions were in the peripheral/middle lung thirds in 92.7%, 49.7% were <20 mm, and 48.4% had a bronchus sign. Radial EBUS was used in 54.3% (543/1,000 subjects) and general anesthesia in 79.7% (797/1,000). Among the 964 subjects (1,129 lesions) undergoing lung lesion biopsy, navigation was completed and tissue was obtained in 94.4% (910/964). Based on final pathology results, ENB-aided samples were read as malignant in 417/910 (45.8%) subjects and non-malignant in 372/910 (40.9%) subjects. An additional 121/910 (13.3%) were read as inconclusive. One-month follow-up in this interim analysis is not sufficient to calculate the true negative rate or diagnostic yield. Tissue adequacy for genetic testing was 80.0% (56 of 70 lesions sent for testing). The ENB-related pneumothorax rate was 4.9% (49/1,000) overall and 3.2% (32/1,000) CTCAE Grade ≥2 (primary endpoint). The ENB-related Grade ≥2 bronchopulmonary hemorrhage and Grade ≥4 respiratory failure rates were 1.0 and 0.6%, respectively. Conclusions: One-month results of the first 1,000 subjects enrolled demonstrate low adverse event rates in a generalizable population across diverse practice settings. Continued enrollment and follow-up are required to calculate the true negative rate and delineate the patient, lesion, and procedural factors contributing to diagnostic yield.",
      "methods": "NAVIGATE is a prospective, multicenter, global, single-arm, cohort study in subjects undergoing ENB procedures using the superDimension navigation system (version 6.0 or higher). Up to 1,500 subjects are planned across 37 sites. This analysis describes a prespecified 1-month interim analysis of the first 1,000 primary cohort subjects enrolled at 29 sites (27 US, 2 Europe) from April 16, 2015 to June 27, 2016. Inclusion criteria were broad: consecutive consented adults who were candidates for elective ENB per clinician discretion and standard-of-care; exclusion included pregnancy or nursing. A maximum of 75 subjects per site; investigators with limited experience could enroll up to five roll-in cases, excluded from this interim analysis. Complementary tools (e.g., EBUS, fluoroscopy), sedation type, and biopsy tools were at clinician discretion. The primary endpoint was ENB-related pneumothorax CTCAE Grade ≥2 at 1 month, adjudicated by an independent medical monitor. Major secondary endpoints included all ENB-related pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure. Additional endpoints: subject satisfaction, adequacy of samples for molecular testing, fiducial placement accuracy, and pleural dye marking success. Diagnostic yield will be calculated at 12 and 24 months; 1-month follow-up is insufficient to calculate true negative rate. Analyses were descriptive using SAS 9.4.",
      "results": "One thousand ENB index procedures were conducted in 1,000 subjects at 29 sites (11 academic, 11 private, 7 mixed). One-month follow-up was completed in 93.3%. COPD was present in 44.8%. Procedures were performed for lung lesion biopsy (n = 964), fiducial placement (n = 210), pleural dye marking (n = 17), and/or lymph node biopsy (n = 334; primarily linear EBUS-guided). General anesthesia was used in 79.7%, radial EBUS in 54.3%, and fluoroscopy in 90.1% of lesions. Median ENB procedure time was 25.0 minutes (IQR 14.0-41.0). Safety: ENB-related pneumothorax CTCAE Grade ≥2 occurred in 3.2% (32/1,000); any-grade pneumothorax in 4.9% (49/1,000). Bronchopulmonary hemorrhage Grade ≥2 occurred in 1.0% (10/1,000); all-grade in 2.3% (23/1,000). Respiratory failure Grade ≥4 occurred in 0.6% (6/1,000). There was one procedure-related death due to anesthesia-related hypoxic respiratory failure 9 days post-ENB; no deaths were considered related to the ENB device or tools. Lung lesion biopsies: among 964 subjects (1,129 lesions), median lesion size was 20.0 mm (IQR 14.0-30.0); 49.7% <20 mm; 62.6% peripheral and 30.1% middle lung third; bronchus sign present in 48.4%. Navigation completed with tissue obtained in 94.4% (910/964) subjects and 91.8% (1,036/1,129) lesions. ROSE used in 66.1% (601/909) subjects. Among 247 lesions with primary lung adenocarcinoma or NSCLC-NOS, molecular testing attempted in 70 (28.3%); adequate tissue in 56/70 (80.0%). ENB-aided pathology read as malignant in 417/910 (45.8%) subjects; non-malignant in 372/910 (40.9%); inconclusive in 121/910 (13.3%). Preliminary clinical stage among primary lung cancer: 52.9% Stage I, 10.7% Stage II, 18.9% Stage III, 17.3% Stage IV. Fiducials: 417 markers in 210 subjects; operator-assessed accurate placement 208/210 (99.0%); marker present on follow-up imaging 192/205 (93.7%). In fiducial subjects, ENB-related AEs included 8 pneumothoraces Grade ≥2 (3.8%), 3 respiratory failures Grade ≥4 (1.4%), and 1 Grade 1 hemorrhage. Pleural dye marking was adequate for resection in 15/17 (88.2%)."
