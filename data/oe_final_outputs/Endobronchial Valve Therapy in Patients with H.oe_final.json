      "abstract": "Rationale: Endobronchial valves (EBVs) have been successfully used in patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema to improve lung physiology. Limited available data suggest that EBVs are also effective in homogeneous emphysema. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of EBVs in patients with homogeneous emphysema with absence of collateral ventilation assessed with the Chartis system. Methods: Prospective, multicenter, 1:1 randomized controlled trial of EBV plus standard of care (SoC) or SoC alone. Primary outcome was the percentage change in FEV1 (liters) at 3 months relative to baseline in the EBV group versus the SoC group. Secondary outcomes included changes in FEV1, St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), 6-minute-walk distance (6MWD), and target lobe volume reduction. Measurements and Main Results: Ninety-three subjects (age, 63.7 ± 6.1 yr; FEV1, % predicted, 29.3 ± 6.5; residual volume, % predicted, 275.4 ± 59.4) were allocated to either the EBV group (n = 43) or the SoC group (n = 50). In the intention-to-treat population, at 3 months postprocedure, improvement in FEV1 from baseline was 13.7 ± 28.2% in the EBV group and -3.2 ± 13.0% in the SoC group (mean between-group difference, 17.0%; P = 0.0002). Other variables demonstrated statistically and clinically significant changes from baseline to 3 months (EBV vs. SoC, respectively: SGRQ, -8.63 ± 11.25 vs. -1.01 ± 9.36; and 6MWD, 22.63 ± 66.63 m vs. -17.34 ± 52.8 m). Target lobe volume reduction at 3 months was -1,195 ± 683 ml (P < 0.0001). Of the EBV subjects, 97.2% achieved volume reduction in the target lobe (P < 0.0001). Procedure-related pneumothoraces occurred in 11 subjects (25.6%). Five subjects required removal/replacement of one or more valves. One subject experienced two valve migration events requiring removal/replacement of valves. Conclusions: EBV in patients with homogeneous emphysema without collateral ventilation results in clinically meaningful benefits of improved lung function, exercise tolerance, and quality of life.",
      "methods": "Prospective, multicenter, one-way crossover, 1:1 randomized controlled trial conducted at eight sites in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. Adults (>40 years), ex-smokers with severe emphysema were screened. Inclusion required FEV1 15-45% predicted, TLC >100% predicted, RV ≥200% predicted, homogeneous emphysema on HRCT defined as <15% difference in destruction score between target and ipsilateral lobes at -910 HU, and <20% right-left perfusion difference. Absence of collateral ventilation (CV) was confirmed using the Chartis system. CV-negative subjects were randomized to EBV plus standard of care (SoC) or SoC alone. EBV subjects received Zephyr endobronchial valves to occlude all segments/subsegments of the target lobe. Follow-up at 3 months assessed spirometry, 6MWD, SGRQ, and (EBV only) HRCT for target lobe volume reduction (TLVR). ITT analyses used last observation carried forward.",
      "results": "Ninety-three subjects were randomized (EBV n=43; SoC n=50). Median 4 valves were placed per EBV subject. Target lobes: 42% LLL, 28% LUL, 21% RLL, 9% RUL. Median postprocedure stay: EBV 6 days (range 3-40), SoC 2 days (1-6). Primary endpoint (ITT): mean % change FEV1 at 3 months 13.7 ± 28.2% (EBV) vs -3.2 ± 13.0% (SoC); between-group difference 17.0% (95% CI 8.1-25.8); P = 0.0002. PP difference 19.3%; P = 0.0003. Secondary: absolute FEV1 between-group difference 120 ml (P < 0.0001). SGRQ change: -8.63 ± 11.25 (EBV) vs -1.01 ± 9.36 (SoC). 6MWD change: +22.63 ± 66.63 m (EBV) vs -17.34 ± 52.8 m (SoC). EBV TLVR at 3 months: -1,195 ± 683 ml (P < 0.0001); 97.2% had any TLVR; 88.9% achieved TLVR ≥350 ml (both P < 0.0001). Adverse events: procedure-related pneumothorax in 11 EBV subjects (25.6%); five EBV subjects required valve removal/replacement; one subject had two valve migration events. One death occurred in the SoC group (pneumonia)."
