      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Bronchoscopic lung-volume reduction with the use of one-way endobronchial valves is a potential treatment for patients with severe emphysema. To date, the benefits have been modest but have been hypothesized to be much larger in patients without interlobar collateral ventilation than in those with collateral ventilation. METHODS We randomly assigned patients with severe emphysema and a confirmed absence of collateral ventilation to bronchoscopic endobronchial-valve treatment (EBV group) or to continued standard medical care (control group). Primary outcomes were changes from baseline to 6 months in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and 6-minute walk distance. RESULTS Eighty-four patients were recruited, of whom 16 were excluded because they had collateral ventilation (13 patients) or because lobar segments were inaccessible to the endobronchial valves (3 patients). The remaining 68 patients (mean [±SD] age, 59±9 years; 46 were women) were randomly assigned to the EBV group (34 patients) or the control group (34). At baseline, the FEV1 and FVC were 29±7% and 77±18% of the predicted values, respectively, and the 6-minute walk distance was 374±86 m. Intention-to-treat analyses showed significantly greater improvements in the EBV group than in the control group from baseline to 6 months: the increase in FEV1 was greater in the EBV group than in the control group by 140 ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 55 to 225), the increase in FVC was greater by 347 ml (95% CI, 107 to 588), and the increase in the 6-minute walk distance was greater by 74 m (95% CI, 47 to 100) (P<0.01 for all comparisons). By 6 months, 23 serious adverse events had been reported in the EBV group, as compared with 5 in the control group (P<0.001). One patient in the EBV group died. Serious treatment-related adverse events in this group included pneumothorax (18% of patients) and events requiring valve replacement (12%) or removal (15%). CONCLUSIONS Endobronchial-valve treatment significantly improved pulmonary function and exercise capacity in patients with severe emphysema characterized by an absence of interlobar collateral ventilation.",
      "methods": "Randomized, controlled, single-center trial at University Medical Center Groningen, Netherlands. Adults >35 years with emphysema, ex-smokers (>6 months), post-bronchodilator FEV1 <60% predicted, total lung capacity >100% predicted, residual volume >150% predicted, and mMRC dyspnea score >1 were eligible. A target lobe with a complete or near-complete fissure on HRCT was required. Absence of interlobar collateral ventilation in the target lobe was confirmed intra-procedurally using the Chartis system during bronchoscopy. Patients were randomized 1:1 (opaque sealed envelopes, blocks of four) to Zephyr endobronchial valve placement (EBV) or continued standard medical care; those in the control group were allowed to cross over to EBV at 6 months. Exclusions at bronchoscopy included evidence of collateral ventilation or airways unsuitable for valve placement. EBV placement occluded all segments/subsegments of the target lobe under conscious sedation or general anesthesia. Primary outcomes were changes from baseline to 6 months in FEV1, FVC, and 6-minute walk distance. Secondary outcomes included SGRQ, CCQ, and HRCT-derived target-lobe volume. Pulmonary function testing and 6MWT followed ATS/ERS standards by assessors blinded to assignment. Intention-to-treat analyses with multiple imputation for missing data were used for primary endpoints; Bonferroni correction applied to the three primary outcomes.",
      "results": "Of 84 screened, 16 were excluded (13 collateral ventilation; 3 anatomy unsuitable). Sixty-eight were randomized (34 EBV, 34 control); 9 EBV and 1 control did not complete 6 months. Baseline FEV1 29±7% predicted; FVC 77±18% predicted; 6MWD 374±86 m. ITT analyses showed greater improvements with EBV vs control from baseline to 6 months: FEV1 mean difference 0.140 L (95% CI, 0.055 to 0.225; P<0.01), FVC mean difference 0.347 L (95% CI, 0.107 to 0.588; P<0.01), 6MWD mean difference 74 m (95% CI, 47 to 100; P<0.01). Among completers (25 EBV, 33 control), differences favored EBV: FEV1 0.191 L (95% CI, 0.109 to 0.272; P<0.001), FVC 0.442 L (95% CI, 0.215 to 0.668; P<0.001), 6MWD 106 m (95% CI, 80 to 133; P<0.001), SGRQ total -14.7 points (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.6; P<0.001), CCQ -0.74 points (95% CI, -1.20 to -0.27; P=0.002). In EBV patients, median target-lobe volume reduction on HRCT was 1366 ml (range, -3604 to -28; P<0.001). Safety through 6 months: serious adverse events were more frequent with EBV (23 events) vs control (5 events) (P<0.001); 1 death occurred in the EBV group. Serious treatment-related events included pneumothorax (18% of patients), valve replacement (12%), and valve removal (15%)."
