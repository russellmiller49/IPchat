      "abstract": "Objective: In addition to use of a laser, argon plasma coagulation, electrocautery, or coring with a rigid bronchoscope, tumor debulking with a flexible cryoprobe is used for therapeutic bronchoscopy with an immediate effect for endobronchial pathologies. We performed this analysis to determine the usefulness, efficacy, and safety of the flexible cryorecanalization in a large population under routine conditions. Methods: We identified 225 bronchoscopic interventions that were done as cryorecanalization with a flexible cryoprobe. All patients had symptomatic airway stenosis. We determined the endoscopic success rate and safety (bleeding and perforation) of the procedure. Results: Successful cryorecanalization was achieved in 205 (91.1%) of 225 patients. The flexible cryoprobe was used with all patients, in most patients in combination with flexible bronchoscopy and only in a minority (n = 31, 13.8%) in combination with a rigid bronchoscope. Additional interventional techniques used were endobronchial stents (n = 11, 4.9%) and argon plasma coagulation (n = 37, 16.4%). Mild bleeding occurred in 9 (4.0%) patients, moderate bleeding occurred in 18 (8.0%) patients, and severe bleeding never occurred. Conclusions: Cryorecanalization with the flexible cryoprobe for treatment of symptomatic endobronchial tumor stenosis is a safe technique with a high success rate and immediate treatment effect.",
      "methods": "We analyzed the data of all patients who underwent bronchoscopy in our clinic from February 2001 to September 2007. We identified all patients undergoing bronchoscopic intervention with the flexible cryoprobe because of an exophytic tumor of the trachea or bronchi with subsequent symptomatic airway stenosis. For any bronchoscopic intervention, a platelet count of at least 100 G/L and normal coagulation parameters (partial thromboplastin time < 40 seconds and prothrombin ratio > 70%) were mandatory; medications influencing clotting time were stopped before intervention (heparin ≥ 12 hours before). The flexible cryoprobe (Erbokryo; ERBE, Tübingen, Germany) was used via flexible bronchoscopy with a tracheal tube or via rigid bronchoscopy. The probe tip was frozen for 3-5 seconds and tumor pieces were extracted repeatedly until the bronchus was reopened; adjunctive argon plasma coagulation (APC) for hemostasis or stent implantation could be performed in the same session. Success was defined endoscopically as reopening enabling secretion drainage or reduced stenosis with symptom improvement. Safety outcomes included bleeding severity (mild, moderate, severe), need for rescue operation, and prolonged mechanical ventilation > 2 hours.",
      "results": "Between February 2001 and September 2007, 5308 bronchoscopies were performed; 225 procedures used cryorecanalization for symptomatic exophytic tumor stenosis. Mean age was 63.9 ± 12.9 years, 69.3% were men, and 85.8% were inpatients. Lesions were central in 44.0%, lobar in 41.3%, and both in 14.7%; 87.6% of stenoses were malignant. Flexible technique alone was used in 86.2% and rigid bronchoscopy in 13.8%; APC was added in 16.4% and stents in 4.9%. Procedural success was achieved in 205/225 (91.1%); failures (8.9%) were mainly due to longer (> 2 cm) complete obstructions. Bleeding occurred in 27/225 (12.0%): mild in 9 (4.0%), moderate in 18 (8.0%), and severe in 0. No pneumothorax occurred. One pneumomediastinum due to minor tracheal injury was managed conservatively with antibiotics and hospitalization; no surgery was required and the patient recovered after 5 days."
