      "abstract": "Background: There is a paucity of published data regarding the optimal type of anesthesia and ventilation strategies during rigid bronchoscopy. Objective: The aim of our study is to report the procedural and anesthesia-related complications with rigid bronchoscopy using total intravenous anesthesia and spontaneous assisted ventilation. Methods: A retrospective review of patients undergoing therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy at the University of Chicago between October 2012 and December 2014 was performed. Data were recorded relating to patients’ demographics, comorbidities, type of anesthesia, need for neuromuscular blockade (NMB), intra-operative hypoxemia, hypotension, perioperative adverse events, and mortality. Results: Fifty-five patients underwent 79 rigid bronchoscopy procedures; 90% were performed for malignant disease and 90% of patients had an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class III or IV. The majority (76%) did not require use of NMB. The most common adverse events were intraoperative hypoxemia (67%) and hypotension (77%). Major bleeding and postoperative respiratory failure occurred in 3.8 and 5.1% of procedures, respectively. There was no intraoperative mortality or cardiac dysrhythmias. The 30-day mortality was 7.6% and was associated with older age, inpatient status, congestive heart failure, home oxygen use, and procedural duration. Intraoperative hypoxemia, hypotension, and ASA class were not associated with 30-day mortality. The majority (94%) of patients were discharged home. The use of NMB did not impact outcomes. Conclusions: This study suggests that therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy can be safely performed with total intravenous anesthesia and spontaneous assisted ventilation in patients with central airway obstruction, significant comorbidities, and a high ASA class. The only significant modifiable variable predicting the 30-day mortality was the duration of the procedure.",
      "methods": "Retrospective evaluation of patients undergoing therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy at the University of Chicago between October 2012 and December 2014. Medical records were reviewed for indications, demographics, comorbidities, anesthetic approach (total intravenous anesthesia with attempts to maintain spontaneous assisted ventilation and avoid neuromuscular blockade), intraoperative hemodynamic and respiratory parameters, and postoperative outcomes. Major bleeding was defined as >200 mL blood loss. Intraoperative hypoxemia was defined as any oxygen saturation <90% for >1 min. Intraoperative hypotension was defined as any systolic blood pressure <100 mm Hg. Postoperative respiratory failure was defined as the need for positive pressure ventilation or an increase in oxygen requirement compared with preoperative levels. Associations were evaluated using χ2 or Fisher’s exact tests for categorical variables and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests for continuous variables. Analyses were performed using Stata 12.",
      "results": "Fifty-five patients underwent 79 therapeutic rigid bronchoscopy procedures (mean age 64 years; 70% outpatient; 89.9% malignant central airway obstruction). The mean ASA score was 3.2. Endoluminal thermal ablation was used in 67 procedures (84.8%); mean procedure duration was 86.5 min. Airway stents were placed in 16 cases (17 stents). Volatile agents were used for induction in 18 procedures (22.8%). Propofol infusion was used in all cases. Neuromuscular blockade (NMB) was avoided in 60 procedures (75.9%); NMB was used in 19 (24.1%), with 6 limited to induction. Vasoactive drugs were administered in 49 cases. Intraoperative hypoxemia occurred in 53 procedures (67.1%) and hypotension in 61 (77.2%). Major bleeding occurred in 3 procedures (3.8%). No cardiac dysrhythmias or intraoperative deaths occurred. Postoperative respiratory failure occurred in 4 patients (5.1%), with 3 requiring positive pressure ventilation. Most patients (75/79, 94.9%) were discharged home. On univariate analysis, factors associated with intraoperative hypoxemia included malignant etiology (p = 0.014), coronary artery disease (p = 0.018), airway stent placement (p = 0.002), and procedure duration >100 min (p < 0.001). No factors were significantly associated with intraoperative hypotension. NMB use was not significantly associated with hypoxemia, respiratory failure, hypotension, or mortality (p > 0.05). Thirty-day mortality occurred in 6 patients (7.6%) and was associated with older age (p = 0.03), inpatient status (p = 0.009), congestive heart failure (p = 0.012), home oxygen use (p = 0.013), and longer procedure duration (p = 0.04) but not with intraoperative hypoxemia (p = 0.658) or hypotension (p = 1.0)."
