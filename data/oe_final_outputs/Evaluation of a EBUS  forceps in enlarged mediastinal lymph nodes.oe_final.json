      "abstract": "Background: Endobronchial ultrasound-transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a useful technique for cytological assessment of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes with a high diagnostic yield for lung cancer. However, the small sample volume can be problematic in diagnosing benign diseases and for molecular analysis of malignant tumours. Objectives: The aim of the study was to evaluate a novel lymph node forceps for EBUS-guided lymph node biopsy (EBUS-transbronchial forceps biopsy; EBUS-TBFB) in malignant and benign conditions concerning safety, feasibility, and diagnostic yield. Methods: Patients with enlarged mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes were included. EBUS-TBNA was performed followed by EBUS-guided TBFB with the lymph node forceps. Three biopsy specimens were obtained. The diagnostic yields of EBUS-TBFB, EBUS-TBNA, and the combination of both sampling techniques were compared. Complications were systematically recorded. Results: Fifty-five patients with enlarged mediastinal nodes were enrolled into this study. Specimens adequate for histological analysis were obtained in all but one case using EBUS-TBFB. EBUS-TBFB increased the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA from 64 to 93% in benign conditions. The overall diagnostic yield was higher compared to EBUS-TBNA alone. EGFR mutation analysis could be achieved in the forceps biopsy samples as needed. No complications were observed. Conclusions: EBUS-TBFB with a novel lymph node forceps is safe and provides adequate histological specimens of enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes. EBUS-TBFB increases the diagnostic yield in benign conditions and may add value in molecular analysis of non-small cell lung cancer.",
      "methods": "Prospective single-centre study of consecutive adults with enlarged (>10 mm) mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes on CT referred for EBUS-TBNA (February-May 2011; March-July 2012). After standard flexible bronchoscopy, EBUS-TBNA was performed under general anaesthesia using an Olympus BF-UC180F bronchoscope connected to EU-ME1 ultrasound. All accessible mediastinal/hilar lymph node stations were systematically assessed; nodes >5 mm were punctured 3 times with a 22-gauge needle (NA-2015X-4022). Subsequently, a single ‘index’ enlarged node per patient underwent EBUS-guided transbronchial forceps biopsy (TBFB) using a novel two-in-one lymph node forceps (MTW Endoskopie) designed to penetrate the airway wall and obtain histologic cores under EBUS guidance. The jabbing technique was used to penetrate the bronchial wall; colour Doppler was used as needed to avoid vessels. Once within the node, the forceps was opened, moved slightly to ensure full opening against tissue resistance, then closed and withdrawn; three specimens were obtained. Patients were observed for 2 h post-procedure and underwent chest radiography. Cytology and histology were independently reviewed by two pathologists; immunohistochemistry and EGFR mutation testing were performed if needed. Sarcoidosis required non-caseating granulomas with supportive clinical/radiologic context and exclusion of other granulomatous diseases; tuberculosis required caseating granulomas with supportive findings and positive PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Negative/ambiguous endoscopic diagnoses were verified by surgery (mediastinoscopy, thoracotomy/VATS) or 6-month clinical/CT follow-up. Diagnostic yields of EBUS-TBNA, EBUS-TBFB, and their combination were compared using McNemar’s test; p<0.05 was considered significant.",
      "results": "Fifty-five patients were enrolled; 7 were excluded (withdrew consent to invasive procedures or follow-up), leaving 48 per-protocol patients (mean age 54 years, range 19-79; 26 males). Index lymph nodes were most often subcarinal (station 7) or right hilar (11R), and most measured 10-20 mm. The forceps penetrated the bronchial wall in all cases; three specimens were obtained from all but one node (two specimens). Adequate histology was obtained in all but the first patient (who had TBNA-compatible sarcoidosis). EBUS-TBFB alone yielded a classifying diagnosis in 32/48 patients (67%): NSCLC 12, SCLC 2, oesophageal cancer relapse 1, sarcoidosis 16, tuberculosis 1. In 16 patients, TBFB was non-diagnostic; subsequent TBNA provided diagnosis in 2 (sarcoidosis 1, large cell carcinoma 1). Surgical/follow-up evaluation in the remainder identified NSCLC (3), anthracosilicosis (2), Castleman’s disease (1), bronchogenic cyst (1), sarcoidosis (1), and benign/reactive nodes (6). Diagnostic accuracy for malignant vs benign by TBNA was 80% (16/20) and 64% (18/28), respectively. Overall, 34/48 (71%) were correctly classified by TBNA. In paired comparison of the same index node, TBFB significantly improved diagnostic yield in benign disease compared to TBNA, and the combined approach (TBNA+TBFB) further improved yield. Table 2: Overall diagnostic accuracy: TBNA 34/48 (71%), TBFB 40/48 (83%), Combined 42/48 (88%), n.s.; Malignant: 16/20 (80%), 15/20 (75%), 16/20 (80%), n.s.; Benign: 18/28 (64%), 25/28 (89%), 26/28 (93%), p<0.05; Sarcoidosis: 11/18 (61%), 16/18 (89%), 17/18 (94%), p<0.05. EGFR mutation analysis was feasible in three TBFB samples (all wild-type). TBFB extended bronchoscopy time by a mean of 6 min (range 2-15). No clinical complications or bronchoscope damage due to TBFB were observed."
