      "abstract": "Objectives: Update evidence-based recommendations for evaluation and management of individuals with solid pulmonary nodules and generate new recommendations for nonsolid nodules. Methods: Prior literature reviews were updated and evidence synthesized using the ACCP Lung Cancer Guidelines 3rd edition methods. Results: Recommendations were formulated for solid nodules >8 mm, solid nodules ≤8 mm, and subsolid nodules (pure ground-glass and part-solid). Key themes include estimating probability of malignancy, appropriate use of imaging (CT, PET), weighing benefits and harms of surveillance, nonsurgical biopsy, and surgical resection, and eliciting patient preferences. Conclusions: Individuals with pulmonary nodules should be evaluated by estimating malignancy probability, performing imaging to better characterize lesions, evaluating risks of management options, and eliciting preferences.",
      "methods": "Searches of MEDLINE for chest CT imaging, PET imaging, transthoracic needle biopsy (TTNB), subsolid nodules, bronchoscopy, surgical complications, and methods to detect nodule growth were performed in October 2011 and updated through May 2012. Additional articles were identified from personal files and reference lists. Included studies comprised randomized trials, controlled observational studies, diagnostic accuracy studies, and cross-sectional studies linking morphology and outcomes. A multidisciplinary committee (pulmonologists, thoracic surgeons, radiologist) formulated questions, synthesized evidence, developed and graded recommendations using standardized ACCP methodology with iterative consensus.",
      "results": "Recommendations cover: General approach (review prior imaging; no further evaluation for solid nodules stable ≥2 years), imaging (CT with thin sections for radiograph-detected nodules), solid nodules >8 mm (estimate pretest malignancy probability; use PET when 5%-65% risk; avoid PET when >65% risk; discuss risks/benefits; CT surveillance schedules; indications for nonsurgical biopsy vs surgical diagnosis), solid nodules ≤8 mm (size- and risk-based CT surveillance intervals), nonsolid nodules (≤5 mm: no further eval; >5 mm: annual CT ≥3 years), part-solid nodules (≤8 mm: CT at ~3, 12, 24 months then annually 1-3 years; >8 mm: repeat CT at 3 months then PET/biopsy/resection if persistent; >15 mm proceed to evaluation). Guidance provided for patients with a dominant nodule plus additional small nodules."
