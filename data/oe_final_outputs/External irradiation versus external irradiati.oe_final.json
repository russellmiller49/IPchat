      "abstract": "Purpose: No randomized studies are available on the additional value of endobronchial brachytherapy (EBB) to external irradiation (XRT) regarding palliation of respiratory symptoms (RS). A prospective randomized study was initiated to test the hypothesis that the addition of EBB to XRT provides higher levels of palliation of dyspnea and other RS and improvement of quality of life (QoL) in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with endobronchial tumour. Materials and methods: Patients with previously untreated NSCLC, stages I-IIIb, WHO-performance status of 0-3 and with biopsy proven endobronchial tumour in the proximal airways were eligible. EBB consisted of two fractions of 7.5 Gy at 1 cm on day 1 and 8. XRT started at day 2. The XRT dose was 30 Gy (2 weeks) or 60 Gy (6 weeks). The EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-LC13 were assessed before treatment and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Re-expansion of collapsed lung was tested by the inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) and CT scan of the chest. Results: Ninety-five patients were randomized between arm 1 (XRT alone) (n = 48) or arm 2 (XRT + EBB) (n = 47). The arms were well balanced regarding pre-treatment characteristics and QoL scores. The compliance for QoL-assessment was >90% at all times. No significant difference between the trial arms was observed with respect to response of dyspnea. However, a beneficial effect of EBB was noted concerning the mean scores of dyspnea over time (P = 0.02), which lasted for 3 months. This benefit was only observed among patients with an obstructing tumour of the main bronchus. A higher rate of re-expansion of collapsed lung was observed in arm 2 (57%) compared to arm 1 (35%) (P = 0.01). The inspiratory vital capacity (IVC) assessed 2 weeks after radiotherapy improved with 493 cm3 in arm 2 and decreased 50 cm3 in arm 1 (P = 0.03). No difference was noted regarding the incidence of massive haemoptysis (13 vs. 15%). Conclusion: The addition of EBB to XRT in NSCLC is safe and provides higher rates of re-expansion of collapsed lung resulting in a transient lower levels of dyspnea. This beneficial effect was only observed among patients with obstructing tumours in the main bronchus.",
      "methods": "Prospective randomized phase III trial. Eligibility: untreated NSCLC stage I-IIIb (UICC 1992), endobronchial tumour in proximal main or lobar bronchus, WHO PS 0-3; no prior/planned chemotherapy, prior surgery, prior radiotherapy, other malignancies, pleuritis carcinomatosa, distant metastases or SVC syndrome; Nd:YAG laser not allowed; complete obstruction or need for ≥2 catheters excluded. Randomization (permuted blocks) centrally with stratification by institution, stage (I-II vs III), and external fractionation schedule (radical 60 Gy vs palliative 30 Gy). XRT: either 30 Gy in 3 Gy fractions 4×/week for 2 weeks (no lung density correction) or 60 Gy: 45 Gy in 2.25 Gy 4×/week to mediastinal volumes with density correction (0.3), then boost to 60 Gy in 2.5 Gy 4×/week. Target volumes included primary tumour, enlarged nodes and mediastinal areas; atelectasis included when present. EBB: HDR Ir-192 via single 3 mm afterloading catheter; 2 fractions of 7.5 Gy at 1 cm on day 1 and day 8; XRT started day 2; EBB and XRT not on same day. QA addressed sequencing, doses, and dose distributions. Staging with exam, CXR, chest CT (incl. liver/adrenals), bronchoscopy; spirometry. Outcomes: primary—response rate of dyspnea (EORTC QLQ-C30/LC13); secondary—re-expansion of atelectasis (CXR/CT/IVC), survival, complications; other RS and QoL exploratory. QoL at baseline, 2 w, 6 w, 3, 6, 12 m after XRT. Statistical analysis: subject-specific short-term response categorization (per Stephens et al.) and group-based repeated measures analysis (SAS Proc Mixed) with F-tests for group, time, and group×time; survival by Kaplan-Meier and log-rank. Planned sample size 160 (power 80%, α=0.05) to detect dyspnea palliation 50%→75%. ITT principle.",
      "results": "Between June 1994 and December 1998, 98 randomized; 3 excluded (distant metastases; prior cervical carcinoma; no histology), leaving 95 eligible (47 XRT alone, 48 XRT+EBB). Groups balanced on baseline clinical characteristics and baseline QoL/RS. Radical schedule used in 75 patients (79%), palliative in 20 (21%). Atelectasis present at baseline in 63 (66%). Compliance to planned external dose: 40/48 (83%) XRT-alone, 41/47 (87%) XRT+EBB; reasons for non-completion included distant progression, local progression, deterioration, massive haemoptysis, intercurrent death. No significant difference in dyspnea response rate between arms; however, repeated-measures showed better dyspnea mean scores over time with EBB (P = 0.02), lasting 3 months, confined to main bronchus obstruction subgroup. Re-expansion of collapsed lung higher with EBB (57%) vs XRT alone (35%) (P = 0.01). IVC at 2 weeks post-RT increased by 493 cm3 with EBB vs decreased by 50 cm3 with XRT alone (P = 0.03). Massive haemoptysis incidence similar (13% vs 15%)."
