      "abstract": "Background: Fiducial markers (FMs) help direct stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) and localization for surgical resection in lung cancer management. We report the safety, accuracy, and practice patterns of FM placement utilizing electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB). Methods: NAVIGATE is a global, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of ENB using the superDimension navigation system. This prospectively collected subgroup analysis presents the patient demographics, procedural characteristics, and 1-month outcomes in patients undergoing ENB-guided FM placement. Follow up through 24 months is ongoing. Results: 258 patients from 21 centers in the United States were included. General anesthesia was used in 68.2%. Lesion location was confirmed by radial endobronchial ultrasound in 34.5% of procedures. The median ENB procedure time was 31.0 min. Concurrent lung lesion biopsy was conducted in 82.6% (213/258) of patients. A mean of 2.2 ± 1.7 FMs (median 1.0) were placed per patient and 99.2% were accurately positioned based on subjective operator assessment. Follow-up imaging showed that 94.1% (239/254) of markers remained in place. The procedure-related pneumothorax rate was 5.4% (14/258) overall and 3.1% (8/258) grade ≥ 2 based on the CTCAE scale. The procedure-related grade ≥ 4 respiratory failure rate was 1.6% (4/258). There were no bronchopulmonary hemorrhages. Conclusion: ENB is an accurate and versatile tool to place FMs for SBRT and localization for surgical resection with low complication rates. The ability to perform a biopsy safely in the same procedure can also increase efficiency. The impact of practice pattern variations on therapeutic effectiveness requires further study.",
      "methods": "NAVIGATE (NCT02410837) is a global, prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study of ENB procedures using the superDimension navigation system. Adult patients undergoing elective ENB-guided FM placement were eligible. ENB-guided FM placement and subsequent SBRT were performed per manufacturer instructions and institutional practice; no protocol-mandated technique was imposed. Procedure-related pneumothorax, bronchopulmonary hemorrhage, and respiratory failure were defined per CTCAE and adjudicated by an independent medical monitor. Risk-based monitoring verified ≥20% of data against source. No sample size calculation was performed for this single-arm subgroup analysis. Descriptive statistics were produced using SAS 9.4.",
      "results": "From 1 May 2015 to 31 August 2016, 258 patients at 21 U.S. centers underwent ENB-guided FM placement; 1-month follow-up was completed in 255/258 (99.8%). General anesthesia was used in 176/258 (68.2%); radial EBUS in 89/258 (34.5%). Median total procedure time was 57.0 min, with median ENB time 31.0 min. In 39 patients with FM placement alone, total and ENB times were 31.0 and 20.0 min, respectively. A total of 563 FMs were placed (mean 2.2 ± 1.7 per patient; median 1; range 1-12). SuperLock nitinol coil was used in 208/258 (80.6%). Operator-assessed accurate placement occurred in 256/258 (99.2%). Follow-up imaging occurred a mean 8.1 days postprocedure (median 0 days); 211/258 (81.8%) had same-day imaging. At follow-up imaging, 239/254 (94.1%) had markers present (4 lacked imaging). Pneumothorax occurred in 14/258 (5.4%) overall; grade ≥2 pneumothorax in 8/258 (3.1%). Respiratory failure occurred in 4/258 (1.6%) (all under general anesthesia): three grade 4 events (all recovered) and one grade 5 anesthesia-related death 9 days postprocedure. No bronchopulmonary hemorrhages were reported. By concomitant procedure: among 219 with additional ENB-guided procedures, pneumothorax all grades 14/219 (6.4%), grade ≥2 8/219 (3.7%), respiratory failure grade ≥4 3/219 (1.4%), deaths 0/219; among 39 with FM-only, pneumothorax 0/39 (0%), respiratory failure grade ≥4 1/39 (2.6%), deaths 1/39 (2.6%)."
