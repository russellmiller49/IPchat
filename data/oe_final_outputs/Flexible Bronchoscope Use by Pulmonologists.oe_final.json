      "abstract": "This study evaluated a 10-year experience with percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy through a transnasal route (TN-PEG) using an adapted flexible bronchoscope in head and neck cancer patients without oral access. In a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients between 2005 and 2014, demographics, TN-PEG outcomes, indications (prophylactic/palliative), clinical need for bronchoscopy (trismus, oropharyngeal obstruction), tumor location, complications, and overall survival were reviewed. Of 40 TN-PEG procedures performed by 1 of 3 pulmonologists, 39 were successfully placed with no immediate complications. Complications were mostly minor and none required surgery or PEG removal. Operators demonstrated a rapid learning curve. Combined TN-PEG placement by a gastroenterologist and a pulmonologist appears safe and useful when oral access is precluded.",
      "methods": "Retrospective single-center review of head and neck cancer patients referred between 2005 and 2014 for PEG placement using the pull method via a transnasal route due to inability to intubate through the oral cavity. The pulmonologist performed transnasal esophagogastroscopy using a 600 mm length, 5.3 mm outer diameter flexible bronchoscope with a 2.2 mm working channel and an adapted Luer lock 3-way stopcock connected to high-pressure vacuum and oxygen systems to allow suction and insufflation. A pediatric endoscopic loop was passed to retrieve the guidewire. The gastroenterologist performed the abdominal portion, including transillumination confirmation, gastric cannulation, and PEG pull-through. Demographics, indication, procedural success, clinical factors (trismus/oropharyngeal obstruction), tumor site, complications (early <7 days, late >7 days), and survival were recorded. Inclusion and exclusion criteria followed standard PEG criteria with added requirement for severe trismus or oral/pharyngeal obstruction.",
      "results": "Forty patients were referred; TN-PEG was successfully placed in 39, with 1 failure due to lack of transillumination. The cohort included 30 men and 9 women with mean age 55 years. Indication was palliative in 27 of 39 and prophylactic in 12 of 39. The transnasal approach was needed for trismus in 25 of 39 and oropharyngeal obstruction in 14 of 39. Tumor sites included nasal cavity/paranasal sinus (2), oral cavity (17), oropharynx (14), larynx (3), hypopharynx (1), facial cutaneous melanoma with muscle involvement (1), and skull base metastasis with masticatory compromise (1). Complications occurred in 9 of 39: early (<7 days) local infections in 4, and late (>7 days) events in 5 (3 local infections, 1 extrusion, 1 Buried Bumper syndrome). No complications required surgery or PEG removal. No immediate (first 24 hours) mechanical or traumatic complications occurred. At follow-up, 10 of 39 were alive (7 in remission), and 29 had died (27 disease progression, 2 unrelated)."
