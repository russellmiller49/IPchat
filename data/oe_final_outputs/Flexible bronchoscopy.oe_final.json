      "results": "This review summarizes typical diagnostic yields reported in the literature for core bronchoscopic techniques (for example, brushing yield around 60 to 90 percent in visible endobronchial lesions; endobronchial biopsy yield at least 70 percent), common practice considerations (lavage volumes, sequence of procedures), and expected risks (hypoxemia during BAL, transient fever after BAL). No single clinical study with primary outcomes, comparative arms, or inferential statistics is presented."
