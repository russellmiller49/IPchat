      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Foreign body aspiration is an uncommon entity in adults. Herein, we describe our experience with flexible bronchoscopy in the removal of tracheobronchial foreign bodies in adults. We also conducted a systematic review of the literature on the topic of foreign body inhalation in adults managed with flexible bronchoscopy. METHODS: The bronchoscopy database (from 1979 to 2014) was reviewed for subjects > 12 y of age with a history of foreign body aspiration managed with flexible bronchoscopy. Demographic, clinical, and bronchoscopy data were collected and analyzed. PubMed was reviewed for studies describing the use of flexible bronchoscopy for foreign body extraction in adults. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 25,998 flexible bronchoscopies were performed. Of these, 65 subjects (mean age of 32.8 y, 49 males) were identified who had undergone bronchoscopy for foreign body aspiration. Nonresolving pneumonia (30.6%), direct foreign body visualization (24.6%), and segmental collapse (18.4%) were the most common radiological abnormalities. Foreign bodies were identified in 49 cases during bronchoscopy and successfully removed in 45 (91.8%) subjects with no major complications. Metallic (41%) and organic (25.6%) foreign bodies were the most common. Shark-tooth (44.9%) and alligator (32.6%) were the most commonly used forceps in retrieving the foreign bodies. The systematic review yielded 18 studies (1,554 subjects with foreign body inhalation). In adults, the proportion of flexible bronchoscopy (6 studies, 354/159,074 procedures) performed for the indication of foreign bodies among the total flexible bronchoscopies was 0.24% (95% CI 0.18-0.31). The overall success of flexible bronchoscopy (18 studies, 1,185 subjects) for foreign body extraction was 89.6% (95% CI 86.1-93.2). CONCLUSIONS: Foreign body aspiration is a rare indication for flexible bronchoscopy in adults. Flexible bronchoscopy has a high success rate in removal of inhaled foreign body and can be considered the preferred initial procedure for management of airway foreign bodies in adults.",
      "methods": "Retrospective analysis of all flexible bronchoscopies performed between September 1979 and April 2014 at a single tertiary care center in Chandigarh, India. Adults (≥ 12 years) with foreign body aspiration managed with flexible bronchoscopy were identified from a bronchoscopy database. Data extracted included demographics, presenting symptoms, radiology, bronchoscopic findings, foreign body type and location, forceps used, outcomes, and complications. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed without sedation using nebulized and topical lidocaine. A systematic PubMed review (English language, ≥ 10 subjects, flexible bronchoscopy management) identified studies for meta-analysis of indication prevalence and extraction success using random-effects pooling of proportions with heterogeneity and publication bias assessments.",
      "results": "Among 25,998 flexible bronchoscopies, 65 (0.25%) were for suspected foreign body inhalation (mean age 32.8 ± 17.9 years; 49 males). Radiological abnormalities were present in 56/65 (86.2%); chest radiograph directly visualized a foreign body in 16/65 (24.6%) and was normal in 9/65. A foreign body was encountered during bronchoscopy in 49/65 (75.3%). Types (n=39 recorded): metallic 16 (41.0%), organic 10 (25.6%), tooth 8 (20.5%), plastic 4 (10.3%), tablet 1 (2.6%). Locations (n=49): right lower-lobe bronchus 15 (30.6%), right intermediate bronchus 8 (16.3%), left main bronchus 10 (20.4%), left lower-lobe bronchus 7 (14.3%), others less frequent. Flexible bronchoscopy successfully removed the foreign body in 45/49 (91.8%); 4 required repeat procedure; 2 failures were removed by rigid bronchoscopy; 2 were lost to follow-up. Forceps used (n=49): shark-tooth 22 (44.9%), alligator 16 (32.6%), others less frequent. Complications occurred in 4/65 (6.2%): mucosal abrasion (n=1) and three instances where the foreign body slipped into the digestive tract after airway extraction; no major complications reported. Systematic review: 18 studies (1,554 adult subjects with foreign body inhalation). Pooled proportion of flexible bronchoscopies performed for foreign body indication among total procedures (6 studies) was 0.24% (354/159,074; 95% CI 0.18-0.31). Pooled success of flexible bronchoscopy for extraction (18 studies, 1,185 subjects) was 89.6% (95% CI 86.1-93.2)."
