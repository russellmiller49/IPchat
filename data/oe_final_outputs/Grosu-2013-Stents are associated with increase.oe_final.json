      "abstract": "Background: Long-term complications of therapeutic bronchoscopy include infections and airway restenosis due to tumor. No studies have compared the incidence rates of infection in patients with stents with those without stents. We hypothesized that patients with stents would have a higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections than would patients without stents. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study (September 2009 to August 2011) of adults undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant airway disease. Outcomes were lower respiratory tract infection and airway restenosis by tumor. Results: Among 72 patients, 24 received one or more stents. Overall, 23/72 (32%) developed lower respiratory tract infections. Stents were associated with increased infection risk (HR 3.76; 95% CI 1.57-8.99; P = .003). Infection incidence rate was 0.0057 per person-day with stents vs 0.0011 without; rate difference 0.0046 per person-day (95% CI 0.0012-0.0081; P = .0002). Restenosis by tumor overgrowth was associated with more severe baseline obstruction (≥50% vs <50%; HR 13.71; 95% CI 1.75-107.55; P = .013). Conclusion: Therapeutic bronchoscopy with stent placement is associated with higher infection risk than bronchoscopy alone; initial deferral of stenting may be warranted when ablative techniques restore patency and tumor is expected to respond to systemic therapy or radiation.",
      "methods": "Retrospective cohort of all patients aged ≥18 years undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction at MD Anderson Cancer Center from September 2009 to August 2011. Excluded patients with malignancy but without malignant central airway obstruction. Procedural data were prospectively collected in an interventional bronchoscopy registry; additional variables were abstracted using a standardized form and codebook. Indications for stenting: (1) pure extrinsic compression with >50% occlusion; (2) inability to achieve >50% patency with ablation alone; or (3) anticipated rapid reocclusion after ablation for mixed obstruction. Outcomes: time to first lower respiratory tract infection (fever, purulent sputum, worsening cough, clinician diagnosis with antibiotics; pneumonia required new consolidation on imaging; otherwise acute bronchitis), time to restenosis from tumor overgrowth, and death. Other adverse events (requiring bronchoscopic verification): granulation tissue causing stent obstruction, mucus impaction requiring therapeutic intervention, stent migration, stent fracture. Times to events measured from first therapeutic bronchoscopy; censoring at last follow-up. Univariate Cox models for time-to-event; extended Cox models used for time-varying covariates (stent present; restenosis). Variables with P < .20 entered multivariable extended Cox with backward selection retaining variables with P < .05. Kaplan-Meier curves plotted. Analyses two-sided; P < .05 significant; STATA/IC 12.1 used.",
      "results": "Seventy-two patients were included; 24 (33.3%) received stents, and 17/24 (71%) had concurrent ablative therapies. Baseline characteristics were similar between stented and non-stented groups. Overall, 23/72 (32%) developed lower respiratory tract infections; median time to infection 64 days (range 7-632). Thirteen infections (56%) required hospitalization; 6 (26%) deaths occurred within 14 days of infection. On multivariable extended Cox analysis, stent placement (time-varying) was associated with increased infection risk (HR 3.76; 95% CI 1.57-8.99; P = .003), and male sex had lower risk vs female (HR 0.40; 95% CI 0.17-0.94; P = .035). Infection incidence rate was 0.0057 per person-day with stents vs 0.0011 without; rate difference 0.0046 per person-day (95% CI 0.0012-0.0081; P = .0002). Fifteen patients (21%) developed restenosis due to tumor overgrowth; median time 108 days (range 34-544); 13/15 (87%) required repeat intervention. Severe baseline obstruction (≥50%) was associated with restenosis (HR 13.71; 95% CI 1.75-107.55; P = .013); incidence rate difference 0.0016 events per person-day (95% CI 0.0005-0.0026; P = .001). Overall, 32/72 (44%) died; in multivariable analysis, infection increased risk of death (HR 11.33; 95% CI 3.82-33.57; P < .001) and post-bronchoscopy chemotherapy reduced risk (HR 0.20; 95% CI 0.09-0.45; P < .001). Other adverse events: granulation tissue 3/72 (4%), mucus impaction 5/72 (7%), stent migration 1/72 (1%), stent fracture 3/72 (4%)."
