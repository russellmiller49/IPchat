      "abstract": "Pleural aspiration (thoracocentesis) and chest drain insertion are common hospital procedures with potential for serious complications. This British Thoracic Society guideline updates prior recommendations, incorporating the UK National Patient Safety Agency 2008 report, and provides practical guidance on training, asepsis, pre-procedure preparation, use of thoracic ultrasound, and safe technique. Evidence indicates that increased operator experience and ultrasound guidance reduce complications such as pneumothorax, dry taps, and inadvertent organ puncture. Recommendations cover when to perform procedures (avoiding out-of-hours unless emergent), anticoagulation thresholds (INR <1.5 for non-urgent procedures), and strong endorsement of real-time thoracic ultrasound for pleural fluid procedures.",
      "methods": "Guideline based on review of observational studies and randomized evidence where available, with recommendations graded by strength of evidence (e.g., U, B, C). A fixed-effects meta-analysis of complication frequencies by operator experience and image guidance was conducted and summarized (Table 1; calculations and references in online appendix). Key comparative studies included one randomized controlled trial (n=52) and multiple retrospective cohorts assessing ultrasound-guided versus clinically localized (blind) pleural aspiration.",
      "results": "Ultrasound guidance reduced failure and complication rates versus blind techniques. In an RCT (n=52), the failure rate (dry tap or pneumothorax) was 33% with blind aspiration and 0% with ultrasound guidance. Retrospective cohorts reported lower pneumothorax with ultrasound (e.g., 18% vs 3% and 10.3% vs 4.9%, with fewer requiring drains). Clinicians accurately identified safe sites clinically in only a proportion of cases; ultrasound increased accurate site selection and avoided potential organ puncture. Among patients with unilateral ‘white-out’ on chest x-ray, 9 of 50 had no pleural effusion on ultrasound, preventing unnecessary procedures. After failed clinical attempts, ultrasound-guided aspiration succeeded in 15 of 17 cases."
