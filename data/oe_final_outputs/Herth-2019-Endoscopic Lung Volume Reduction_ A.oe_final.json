      "abstract": "Endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) therapies are gaining prominence as a treatment option with guideline recommendations by COPD GOLD and NICE and the recent FDA approval for endobronchial valves. The transition from an experiment-based therapy only to clinical care comes with new challenges. A significant volume of evidence-based data has been published; all data demonstrate consistent improvements in several aspects of patient outcomes. Patients suffering from severe air trapping and thoracic hyperinflation seem to benefit the most from ELVR. In addition to lung function, baseline assessment should ideally include cardiopulmonary exercise testing, high-resolution computer tomography scan, perfusion scintigraphy, and echocardiography. This expert ELVR statement updates best practice recommendations from 2017 regarding patient selection and utilization of these various techniques for treating patients with advanced emphysema.",
      "methods": "Expert panel narrative update of prior recommendations incorporating recently published randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses. Recommendations cover patient selection, imaging assessment (including fissure analysis and Chartis), device updates (endobronchial valves, intrabronchial valves/Spiration Valve System, coils, vapor), complications management, and survival signals.",
      "results": "The LIBERATE RCT (n=190; 2:1 EBV:standard-of-care at 24 sites) reported at 12 months a higher proportion of patients achieving post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement ≥15% with EBV versus standard care (47.7% vs 16.8%; p<0.001). Between-group differences favored EBV for absolute FEV1 change (+0.106 L; p<0.001), 6MWD (+39.31 m; p=0.002), SGRQ (-7.05 points; p=0.004), and RV (-522 mL; p<0.001). Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event during the procedure-to-45-day period in 34/128 (26.6%) EBV subjects. Additional RCT data for the Spiration Valve System showed improvements in FEV1, SGRQ, and 6MWD with pneumothorax and COPD exacerbations as the most common complications. The panel provides updated selection and procedural recommendations including imaging-based fissure assessment thresholds and the use of Chartis in partially complete fissures."
