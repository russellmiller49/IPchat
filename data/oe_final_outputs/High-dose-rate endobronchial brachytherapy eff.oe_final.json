      "abstract": "Purpose: To evaluate the toxicity and efficacy of Iridium-192 high-dose-rate (HDR) endobronchial brachytherapy (EBBT) for the palliation of symptoms caused by relapsed or persistent endobronchial tumors. Methods and Materials: We reviewed the treatment outcomes between 1988 and 1997 in 175 lung cancer patients who underwent HDR EBBT for recurrent or metastatic tumors at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. One hundred sixty of these patients had previously received thoracic external-beam irradiation. This updated report includes 74 patients from a previous series. Most patients received 3,000-cGy EBBT delivered at a distance of 6 mm and divided into 2 fractions over 2 weeks. Subjective response was assessed by questionnaire at follow-up. Objective response was assessed by physical examination, bronchoscopy, and chest radiograph. Results: The median actuarial survival for the entire group was 6 months from the time of the first EBBT treatment session. Of the 115 patients (66%) who showed symptomatic improvement, 32% were much improved and 34% were slightly improved. Patients showing improvement survived for significantly longer than those who showed no change or worsening symptoms (7 vs. 4 months, p = 0.0032). Repeat bronchoscopy demonstrated a 78% overall objective response rate that correlated significantly with subjective response and symptom relief. Complications occurred in 19 patients (11% crude rate) with an actuarial complication rate of 13% at 1 year from the time of the first EBBT treatment session. The actuarial hazard for fatal hemoptysis due to EBBT was 5%. Conclusion: HDR EBBT effectively palliates most patientsâ€™ symptoms caused by endobronchial lesions. This relief correlates significantly with an overall survival benefit. Treatment complications appear to be few, even for patients who have received prior external-beam irradiation.",
      "methods": "Retrospective review of 175 consecutive lung cancer patients treated with HDR endobronchial brachytherapy (EBBT) at MD Anderson between November 1988 and December 1997. Eligibility included tolerance of bronchoscopy, absence of bleeding disorder, significant symptomatic endotracheal/endobronchial tumor, inability to undergo resection, or prior thoracic external-beam radiotherapy precluding further EBRT. Only tumors with an endoluminal obstructive component were included. Procedures were performed under intravenous sedation with flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy; a 6-French nylon catheter was positioned transnasally into the airway lumen and verified fluoroscopically. Dosimetry planned with orthogonal radiographs; Ir-192 Microselectron HDR afterloader used. Prescribed dose typically 15 Gy per procedure at 6 mm (endobronchial) or 7.5 mm (endotracheal), usually delivered in two procedures 2 weeks apart. Some patients had Nd:YAG laser debulking or paclitaxel infusion as radiosensitizer. Subjective response assessed by questionnaire; objective response by repeat bronchoscopy and chest radiography, usually within 2 weeks. Complications assessed at follow-up. Kaplan-Meier used for survival and duration of symptom relief; Pearson Chi-square for associations; Wilcoxon-Gehan for group survival comparisons.",
      "results": "Of 175 patients (median age 60; KPS median 70), baseline symptoms included dyspnea in 149 (85%), cough in 133 (76%), hemoptysis in 60 (34%), and wheezing in 47 (27%). Most received 30 Gy total (two 15 Gy procedures); 115 (66%) had two applications, 45 (26%) one, and 15 (9%) three. Subjective outcome (n=162 assessed): 115 improved (56 much, 59 slight), 29 no relief, 18 worsened; mean duration of response 3.8 months. Objective bronchoscopic response (n=115): complete in 14 (12%), partial in 76 (66%), none in 23 (20%), progression in 2 (2%); overall response 90/115 (78%). Subjective response significantly associated with objective response (p = 0.024). Chest radiography improved/stable in 136/154 (88%), worsened in 18/154 (12%). Median actuarial overall survival from first EBBT was 6 months (range 0-54). Patients with symptomatic improvement had longer survival vs no change/worsening (median 7 vs 4 months; p = 0.0032). Pre-EBBT cough associated with worse survival (p = 0.05). Complications in 19/175 patients (11% crude); actuarial risk of any complication 13% at 1 year. Eight patients died of massive hemoptysis post-EBBT; 3 attributed to EBBT (actuarial hazard 2% at 6 months, plateauing at 5% at 14 months). Four deaths from local tumor progression with hemoptysis, and one death from pulmonary artery laceration during follow-up bronchoscopy elsewhere. Other treatment-related fatal complications: 1 necrosis with fistula, 1 stenosis with necrosis. Nonfatal events: pneumothorax in 4, nonfatal hemoptysis in 2, necrosis in 2, esophageal stricture in 1."
