      "abstract": "Background: Tracheobronchial stents are widely used devices in interventional pulmonology; however, the current literature on the effectiveness and complication rates of the different types of stents is limited. Objective: We report the largest case series of airway Bonastent placement and describe the efficacy and early (<30 days) and late (≥30 days) complication rates. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of our prospectively collected database of patients who underwent therapeutic bronchoscopy with stent placement. All adult patients who had a tracheal/bronchial Bona-stent placed between July 1, 2017, and July 30, 2019, for any indication at our institution were included. The efficacy as well as intraoperative and short- and long-term complications of Bonastent placement were evaluated. Results: Sixty Bonastents were placed in 50 patients. The etiology was malignant in 90% of the cases, while 2 patients had a tracheoesophageal fistula. All procedures were performed via rigid bronchoscopy. The most common location for stent placement was the bronchus intermedius, followed by the trachea, in 32 and 30% of the cases, respectively. Seventy percent of the patients (35/50) had improvement of respiratory symptoms within 30 days. Twenty-eight stents (48%) were removed at a mean of 74 days. Seventeen patients (34%) died within 30 days of stent placement. The overall complication rate was 54% (27/50 patients) at a mean follow-up of 111 days. The stent-related complication rate was 23.3% (14/60 cases) within <30 days and 53% (18/34 cases) at ≥30 days. Conclusions: The tracheobronchial Bonastent is effective for the treatment of patients with central airway obstruction and tracheoesophageal fistulae with an acceptable safety profile.",
      "methods": "Retrospective review of a prospectively collected database at a single academic medical center. Inclusion: all patients aged ≥18 years who had a tracheal/bronchial Bonastent placed between July 1, 2017 and July 30, 2019 for any indication. Variables predefined and extracted from the electronic medical record. Outcomes included efficacy (patient-reported respiratory symptom improvement; mMRC dyspnea scale) and complications assessed at <30 days and ≥30 days. Complications: granulation tissue requiring bronchoscopic intervention, infectious tracheobronchitis or pneumonia, mucous plugging requiring intervention, stent migration, stent fracture. Operative technique: all procedures under general anesthesia via rigid bronchoscopy; airway measurements by CT and intraoperative AEROSIZER; deployment under flexible bronchoscopy visualization without fluoroscopy; standardized post-procedure mucociliary clearance regimen (guaifenesin ER 1200 mg, nebulized 5 mL normal saline, flutter valve twice daily) and 4-6 week clinic follow-up with chest CT. Statistical methods: Shapiro-Wilk to assess normality; continuous variables summarized as mean ± SD or median (range); dichotomous variables as proportions.",
      "results": "Sixty Bonastents were placed in 50 patients (54% female), mean age 64.9 ± 13.1 years. Etiologies: malignant CAO 90% (mixed 82.2%, extrinsic 17.8%), benign 6%, malignant TEF 4%. Stent locations: bronchus intermedius 32%, trachea 30%, left mainstem 28%, right mainstem 10%. Multimodal therapy used in 78% (balloon dilation 58%, electrosurgery 39%, cryotherapy 25%). Improper deployment occurred in 1/60 cases; no intraoperative hypoxia, bleeding, perforation, inadequate expansion, or respiratory failure. Symptom improvement occurred in 35/50 patients (70%) within 30 days and in 18/28 patients (64.3%) at ≥30 days. On a per-stent basis, improvement in 39/60 (65%) at <30 days and 19/34 (55.9%) at ≥30 days. Mean mMRC was 3.3 ± 1.2 at baseline, 2.7 ± 1.0 within 30 days, and 2.4 ± 0.7 at ≥30 days. Stent removal occurred for 28/60 stents (47%) at a mean of 74 ± 69 days, for reasons including no longer needed (6), TEF progression (4), migration (4), granulation tissue (3), mucus plugging (2), stent fracture/bowing (2), respiratory failure (2), distal stenosis (1), lack of symptom improvement (1), prior to surgery (1), other (2). Thirty-day mortality was 17/50 patients (34%), most commonly from disease progression (10); 1 possible stent-related death due to suspected mucus plugging. Overall patient-level complication rate was 27/50 (54%) at mean follow-up 111 ± 145 days. Stent-related complications per-stent: early <30 days 14/60 (23.3%) and late ≥30 days 18/34 (52.9%). Early events: mucous plugging 5/60 (8.3%), granulation tissue 4/60 (6.7%), respiratory infection 4/60 (6.7%), migration 3/60 (5.0%), chronic cough 3/60 (5.0%). Late events: mucous plugging 8/34 (23.5%), respiratory infection 8/34 (23.5%), granulation tissue 5/34 (14.7%), chronic cough 5/34 (14.7%), migration 2/34 (5.9%), fracture 1/34 (2.9%). Bronchoscopic intervention was required in 9/14 early events and 14/18 late events."
