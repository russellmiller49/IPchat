      "abstract": "Interventional pulmonology (IP) is a rapidly evolving subspecialty of pulmonary medicine. In the last 10 years, formal IP fellowships have increased substantially in number from five to now > 30. The vast majority of IP fellowship trainees are selected through the National Resident Matching Program, and validated in-service and certification examinations for IP exist. Practice standards and training guidelines for IP fellowship programs have been published; however, considerable variability in the environment, curriculum, and experience offered by the various fellowship programs remains, and there is currently no formal accreditation process in place to standardize IP fellowship training. Recognizing the need for more uniform training across the various fellowship programs, a multisociety accreditation committee was formed with the intent to establish common accreditation standards for all IP fellowship programs in the United States. This article provides a summary of those standards and can serve as an accreditation template for training programs and their offices of graduate medical education as they move through the accreditation process.",
      "methods": "In 2014, the AABIP and AIPPD created a committee with the mandate to establish accreditation standards for IP fellowship programs in the United States. The initial framework of the accreditation document was constructed by using existing ACGME accreditation standards for medicine subspecialty fellowships, anesthesia, and thoracic surgery, including educational standards, faculty/institution requirements, fellowship appointment, and evaluations. Deliberation and voting were conducted using Delphi methods. The draft accreditation standard was reviewed and revised by CHEST, ATS, and APCCMPD with additional input from the CHEST Training and Transitions Committee and the Interventional Chest/Diagnostic Procedures NetWork Steering Committee. The final multisociety accreditation standard was approved in June 2016 by AABIP, CHEST, AIPPD, APCCMPD, and ATS.",
      "results": "The standard outlines minimum requirements to ensure accredited IP fellowship programs possess adequate resources, facilities, expertise, curriculum, and procedural volumes to train fellows. It is not intended to assign competence to individual graduates but to ensure an environment for achieving competence, with determinations of independent practice left to program leadership, board certification, and institutional credentialing. Duration: programs must be at least 12 months, with a minimum of 9 months in direct IP clinical training and inclusion of associated specialties and research. Sponsoring institution: must also sponsor or participate in an ACGME-accredited pulmonary or pulmonary/critical care fellowship, provide administrative resources, and support at least 10% of the program directorâ€™s salary or protected time; ensure facilities, EMR, library resources, and core clinical support services. Participating sites require program letters of agreement. Program leadership and faculty: a single program director board-certified in IP with at least 5 years faculty experience in an ACGME-accredited pulmonary or pulmonary/critical care fellowship and at least 50% effort in IP; key clinical faculty (KCF) requirements include at least one KCF for up to two fellows per year and at least one additional KCF per every 1.5 fellows beyond two, with KCFs board-certified in IP and dedicating at least 33% effort to IP; sufficient associated specialty faculty must maintain primary subspecialty board certification. Fellow appointments: entrants must have completed an ACGME- or Royal College-accredited pulmonary or pulmonary/critical care fellowship; programs must ensure adequate patient and procedural exposure. Educational program: includes broad exposure to malignant and nonmalignant thoracic disease, weekly conferences (case, journal club, research, morbidity and mortality or quality improvement), and outpatient clinic participation with at least 44 half-day clinics during 12 months; fellows must engage in research or scholarly activity; training must cover all ACGME competencies. Medical knowledge: require a didactic series with at least monthly faculty lectures; a core curriculum covers IP-relevant science, technology, imaging, and disease topics. Patient care: fellows must achieve competence in essential IP procedures; competency determination is multifactorial and may use validated tools; simulation (cadaveric, animal, and/or manufactured) is required; programs must meet minimum institutional procedural volumes for core IP procedures to ensure adequate exposure."
