      "abstract": "Background and objective: The diagnostic yield of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is inferior to that of computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsy for pulmonary nodules. One explanation for this is divergence between the nodule location on the pre-procedure CT scan and its actual location during the procedure. Fluoroscopic ENB (F-ENB) consists of digital tomosynthesis using a conventional C-arm to re-register the target lesion based on near real-time imaging. We performed a retrospective review of ENB cases at our institution before and after introduction of F-ENB to assess diagnostic yield. Methods: All consecutive ENB procedures performed at our institution from 25 December 2017 to 25 August 2018 were reviewed. F-ENB was introduced on 25 April 2018. Two cohorts were analysed: standard ENB (S-ENB) from 25 December 2017 to 24 April 2018 and F-ENB from 25 April 2018 to 25 August 2018. All procedural, demographic and diagnostic data were collected. Descriptive statistics, chi-square, Wilcoxon test and Student’s t-test were used where appropriate. A multivariable regression analysis was performed to assess factors associated with diagnostic yield. Results: A total of 101 and 67 nodules were biopsied in the S-ENB and F-ENB groups, respectively. Diagnostic yield was 54% in S-ENB cohort and 79% in the F-ENB group (P = 0.0019). Factors independently associated with a positive diagnosis were F-ENB and a positive radial ultrasound view (odds ratio (OR): 3.57, 95% CI: 1.56-8.18 and OR: 3.74, 95% CI: 1.37-11.05, respectively). Complications were minimal (pneumothorax: 1.5%). Conclusion: The use of F-ENB may increase the diagnostic yield of ENB and has a low complication rate.",
      "methods": "We conducted a retrospective review of all consecutive ENB procedures performed at Vanderbilt University Medical Center from 25 December 2017 to 25 August 2018 (IRB 181411; consent waived). F-ENB was introduced on 25 April 2018; data from 4 months prior and 4 months after introduction were included. The SuperDimension iLogic 7.2 ENB platform was used for all procedures. F-ENB uses digital tomosynthesis via a conventional GE 9800/9900 C-arm to visualize and re-register the target nodule based on near real-time imaging using an inspiratory breath-hold and fluoroscopy sweep from 25° LAO to 25° RAO. After re-registration, the locatable guide and extended working channel (EWC) are redirected to achieve central target alignment. Not all post-April 24 procedures used F-ENB due to equipment availability and operator discretion after rEBUS assessment. Rapid onsite cytology was used; TBNA was performed first, with TBBX and a 10-mL wash if ROSE was non-diagnostic or infection suspected. Positive diagnosis was defined as malignancy, specific benign histopathology or positive microbiology; normal lung, atypia or non-specific inflammation were non-diagnostic. Primary outcome was diagnostic yield per nodule. Divergence for F-ENB cases was defined as catheter-to-nodule distance after tomosynthesis sweep. Group comparisons used Wilcoxon rank-sum or t-test and chi-square; multivariable logistic regression adjusted for rEBUS image, size, location and air bronchogram.",
      "results": "A total of 101 nodules in 90 subjects underwent S-ENB and 67 nodules in 59 subjects underwent F-ENB. Diagnostic yield was higher with F-ENB (53/67; 79%) than S-ENB (55/101; 54%) (P = 0.0019). Nodule sizes were similar between cohorts (median 16 mm vs 15 mm; P = 0.56). In nodules <20 mm, sizes were also similar (14 mm vs 13 mm; P = 0.27). Median divergence in F-ENB cases was 12.2 mm (IQR 7-17). rEBUS view, nodule location, opacity type, and biopsy methods were similar between groups; bronchus sign was more common in S-ENB (37% vs 22%; P = 0.04). Among F-ENB diagnostic cases, 35/53 (66%) were diagnosed by cytology alone, 10/53 (18%) by histology alone and 6/53 (11%) by both; in S-ENB, 23/55 (43%) cytology alone, 15/55 (27%) histology alone and 18/55 (33%) both. In multivariable logistic regression, F-ENB (OR 3.57; 95% CI 1.56-8.18) and positive rEBUS view (OR 3.74; 95% CI 1.37-11.05) independently predicted diagnosis. Complications were minimal, with pneumothorax reported at 1.5% overall."
