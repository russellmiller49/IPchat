      "abstract": "Introduction: Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool for the management of airway disorders and an essential skill for an interventional pulmonologist. Since its introduction in the late 19th century, it has remained an important technique for the management of central airway obstruction, foreign body aspiration and massive hemoptysis. Areas covered: This article will review the history, indications, contraindication, technique and complications of rigid bronchoscopy. We will also briefly discuss the methods of anesthesia and ventilation and finally our perspective on the future of rigid bronchoscopy. Expert commentary: Although the rise of flexible bronchoscopy in the 1960s led to a decline in the use of rigid bronchoscopy, the last two decades have witnessed resurgence in its popularity. We anticipate that it will remain an important tool used by interventional pulmonologists for decades to come. We suggest that interventional pulmonologists must have training and develop expertise in this technique.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of the history, equipment, techniques, indications, contraindications, anesthesia and ventilation methods, and complications related to rigid bronchoscopy. No formal systematic search strategy, randomization, or quantitative meta-analysis described.",
      "results": "Summarizes the evolution and current applications of rigid bronchoscopy. Highlights technical advantages over flexible bronchoscopy for central airway obstruction, foreign body removal, and management of massive hemoptysis. Describes equipment (bronchoscopes, optics, accessory instruments), procedural techniques (intubation approaches), and ventilation strategies including manual jet ventilation. Notes potential complications such as hypoxemia and pneumothorax risks, but provides no pooled quantitative estimates."
