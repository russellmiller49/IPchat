      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis is a disease characterized by abnormal accumulation of surfactant in the alveoli. Most cases are autoimmune and are associated with an autoantibody against granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) that prevents clearing of pulmonary surfactant by alveolar macrophages. An open-label, phase 2 study showed some therapeutic efficacy of inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF in patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; however, the efficacy in patients with mild-to-moderate disease remains unclear. METHODS We conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of daily inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF (sargramostim), at a dose of 125 μg twice daily for 7 days, every other week for 24 weeks, or placebo in 64 patients with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis who had a partial pressure of arterial oxygen (Pao2) while breathing ambient air of less than 70 mm Hg (or <75 mm Hg in symptomatic patients). Patients with severe pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (Pao2 <50 mm Hg) were excluded to avoid possible exacerbation of the disease in patients who were assigned to receive placebo. The primary end point was the change in the alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient between baseline and week 25. RESULTS The change in the mean (±SD) alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient was significantly better in the GM-CSF group (33 patients) than in the placebo group (30 patients) (mean change from baseline, -4.50±9.03 mm Hg vs. 0.17±10.50 mm Hg; P=0.02). The change between baseline and week 25 in the density of the lung field on computed tomography was also better in the GM-CSF group (between-group difference, -36.08 Hounsfield units; 95% confidence interval, -61.58 to -6.99, calculated with the use of the Mann-Whitney U test and the Hodges-Lehmann estimate of confidence intervals for pseudo-medians). Serious adverse events developed in 6 patients in the GM-CSF group and in 3 patients in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS In this randomized, controlled trial, inhaled recombinant human GM-CSF was associated with a modest salutary effect on the laboratory outcome of arterial oxygen tension, and no clinical benefits were noted.",
      "methods": "Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial across Niigata University Medical and Dental Hospital and 11 other hospitals in Japan. Adults aged 16-80 years with autoimmune pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (HRCT and/or biopsy/bronchoalveolar lavage confirmation), positive anti-GM-CSF antibody (>1.0 μg/mL), and impaired oxygenation (Pao2 <70 mm Hg on room air supine for 5 minutes, or <75 mm Hg with symptoms) were eligible. Exclusions included whole-lung lavage in the prior 6 months, prior GM-CSF or cytokine therapy, pregnancy, and severe hypoxemia (Pao2 <50 mm Hg). Participants were randomized 1:1 to inhaled sargramostim 125 μg twice daily on days 1-7 of each 14-day cycle for 12 cycles (24 weeks) or matched placebo. Assessments included arterial blood gases, pulmonary function, 6-minute walk, HRCT densitometry, and serum biomarkers at baseline and weeks 7, 13, 19, 25, 31, 37, and 43. The primary endpoint was change in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient from baseline to week 25. Analyses were intention-to-treat; between-group comparisons mainly used Mann-Whitney U tests; within-group changes used sign tests. Longitudinal effects were assessed via linear mixed-effects models including time, treatment, and their interaction, with Kenward-Roger adjustment, without imputation.",
      "results": "Seventy-eight patients were screened; 64 were randomized (33 GM-CSF, 31 placebo). One placebo patient withdrew; 63 completed 24 weeks. Primary endpoint: mean (±SD) change in alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient from baseline to week 25 was -4.50±9.03 mm Hg (GM-CSF) vs 0.17±10.50 mm Hg (placebo); P=0.02. The improvement was driven by higher Pao2 in the GM-CSF group: mean change 4.77±9.43 mm Hg vs -0.05±9.48 mm Hg; model-based difference vs placebo 5.40 mm Hg (95% CI, 1.00 to 9.90). HRCT densitometry change from baseline to week 25 was -22.4 Hounsfield units (GM-CSF) vs -2.5 (placebo); Hodges-Lehmann between-group difference -36.08 (95% CI, -61.58 to -6.99), Mann-Whitney U. No substantial differences were observed in COPD Assessment Test scores; mixed-effects modeling showed a small difference in modified MRC dyspnea scale slope (interaction per month 0.07; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.13). Serious adverse events occurred in 6/33 GM-CSF patients and 3/31 placebo patients."
