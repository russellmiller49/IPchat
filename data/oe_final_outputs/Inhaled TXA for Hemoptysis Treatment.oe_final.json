      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid (TA) is an antifibrinolytic drug currently used systemically to control bleeding. To date, there have been no prospective studies of the effectiveness of inhaled TA for the treatment of hemoptysis. OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study was to prospectively assess the effectiveness of TA inhalations (ie, nebulized TA) for hemoptysis treatment. METHODS: This analysis was a double-blind, randomized controlled trial of treatment with nebulized TA (500 mg tid) vs placebo (normal saline) in patients admitted with hemoptysis of various etiologies. Patients with massive hemoptysis (expectorated blood > 200 mL/24 h) and hemodynamic or respiratory instability were excluded. Mortality and hemoptysis recurrence rate were assessed at 30 days and following 1 year. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were randomized to receive TA inhalations (n=25) or normal saline (n=22). TA was associated with a significantly reduced expectorated blood volume starting from day 2 of admission. Resolution of hemoptysis within 5 days of admission was observed in more TA-treated patients than in those receiving placebo (96% vs 50%; P < .0005). Mean hospital length of stay was shorter for the TA group (5.7 ± 2.5 days vs 7.8 ± 4.6 days; P = .046), with fewer patients requiring invasive procedures such as interventional bronchoscopy or angiographic embolization to control the bleeding (0% vs 18.2%; P = .041). No side effects were noted in either group throughout the follow-up period. In addition, a reduced recurrence rate was noted at the 1-year follow-up (P = .009). CONCLUSIONS: TA inhalations can be used safely and effectively to control bleeding in patients with nonmassive hemoptysis.",
      "methods": "Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial conducted at Meir Medical Center, Israel. Adults admitted with hemoptysis within the prior 24 hours were screened. Exclusions: massive hemoptysis (>200 mL/24h), respiratory/hemodynamic instability, pregnancy, renal failure (creatinine >3 mg/dL or renal replacement therapy), hepatic failure (bilirubin >2 mg/dL or AST >3× ULN), coagulopathy (INR >2), hypersensitivity to TA, or prior TA treatment. Participants were randomized to nebulized TA 500 mg/5 mL or normal saline 0.9% 5 mL, three times daily, for up to 5 days from admission. Anticoagulants/antiplatelets were held until bleeding resolution. Outcomes: primary—complete resolution of hemoptysis within 5 days and daily expectorated blood volume; secondary—rates of interventional bronchoscopy, angiographic embolization, or surgery; hospital length of stay; safety; 30-day and 1-year mortality and recurrence.",
      "results": "Forty-seven patients were randomized (TA n=25; placebo n=22). Resolution of bleeding by day 5 occurred in 96% (24/25) of TA vs 50% (11/22) of placebo (P < .0005). TA reduced expectorated blood volume from day 2 to day 5 (P < .01). Fewer patients required interventional procedures in the TA group (0/25) vs placebo (4/22; 18.2%) (P = .041). Mean hospital length of stay was shorter with TA (5.7 ± 2.5 days) vs placebo (7.8 ± 4.6 days) (P = .046). No adverse effects, including bronchospasm, occurred in either group during follow-up. At 30 days, recurrent hemoptysis occurred in 2/25 vs 6/22 (P = .12) and death in 0/25 vs 2/22 (P = .21). At 1 year, recurrent hemoptysis was lower with TA (3/25) vs placebo (11/22) (P = .0092); mortality was similar (4/25 vs 4/22)."
