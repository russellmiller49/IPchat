      "abstract": "For over 150 years, bronchoscopy, especially flexible bronchoscopy, has been a mainstay for airway inspection, the diagnosis of airway lesions, therapeutic aspiration of airway secretions, and transbronchial biopsy to diagnose parenchymal lung disorders. Its utility for the diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary nodules and therapeutic treatments besides aspiration of airway secretions, however, has been limited. Challenges to the wider use of flexible bronchoscopy have included difficulty in navigating to the lung periphery, the avoidance of vasculature structures when performing diagnostic biopsies, and the ability to biopsy a lesion under direct visualization. The last 10-15 years have seen major advances in thoracic imaging, navigational platforms to direct the bronchoscopist to lung lesions, and the ability to visualize lesions during biopsy. Moreover, multiple new techniques have either become recently available or are currently being investigated to treat a broad range of airway and lung parenchymal diseases, such as asthma, emphysema, and chronic bronchitis, or to alleviate recurrent exacerbations. New bronchoscopic therapies are also being investigated to not only diagnose, but possibly treat, malignant peripheral lung nodules. As a result, flexible bronchoscopy is now able to provide a new and expanding armamentarium of diagnostic and therapeutic tools to treat patients with a variety of lung diseases. This State-of-the-Art review succinctly reviews these techniques and provides clinicians an organized approach to their role in the diagnosis and treatment of a range of lung diseases.",
      "methods": "State-of-the-Art narrative review. The article summarizes advances in imaging, navigational platforms, and therapeutic bronchoscopic techniques for lung diseases using published studies including meta-analyses, multicenter cohorts, and device-specific reports. No formal head-to-head comparative effectiveness or cost-effectiveness analyses were performed by the authors; the review highlights that technologies have not been directly compared for diagnostic yield or cost effectiveness.",
      "results": "Key findings summarized include: radial EBUS is widely used for real-time lesion confirmation; a large evaluation (>1,400 patients) reported specificity 1.00 and sensitivity 0.73 for lung cancer diagnosis, with yield influenced by lesion size, probe position, and fluoroscopy use. A multicenter controlled trial comparing thin bronchoscope plus rEBUS versus standard bronchoscopy plus fluoroscopy showed diagnostic yields of 49% versus 37%, not statistically significant. Combining rEBUS with ENB improves diagnostic yield over either modality alone. ENB meta-analyses report diagnostic accuracies around 70-75%; the NAVIGATE study (n=1,157) reported 94% navigation completion and a diagnostic yield of 73%. Virtual bronchoscopic navigation can achieve yields around 80% in solitary pulmonary nodules, with performance dependent on lesion size, lobar location, and the bronchus sign. Transparenchymal nodule access systems (e.g., Archimedes, TBAT) aim to reach lesions lacking a bronchus sign; yields depend on lesion size and may approach 100% when combined with rEBUS/ENB and CBCT, at the expense of increased procedure time and radiation. CT bronchoscopy and CBCT can address CT-to-body divergence and improve tool-target alignment; reported navigational and diagnostic yields include 91% and 70%, respectively, with higher yields in malignant lesions near the pleura. Therapeutic applications span emphysema (endobronchial valves, coils, thermal vapor ablation, polymeric agents), asthma (bronchial thermoplasty), chronic bronchitis (rheoplasty, cryospray, microdebrider), total lung denervation, malignant nodule ablation (radiofrequency, microwave, cryoablation, photodynamic therapy, brachytherapy, chemoinjection), and airway patency interventions (stenting, bronchoplasty, electrocautery, debridement). Complications noted across therapies include pneumothorax, exacerbations, pneumonia, granulation tissue, and bleeding."
