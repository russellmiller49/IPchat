      "abstract": "Background: More than 30% of patients with pleural infection either die or require surgery. Drainage of infected fluid is key to successful treatment, but intrapleural fibrinolytic therapy did not improve outcomes in an earlier, large, randomized trial. Methods: We conducted a blinded, 2-by-2 factorial trial in which 210 patients with pleural infection were randomly assigned to receive one of four study treatments for 3 days: double placebo, intrapleural tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and DNase, t-PA and placebo, or DNase and placebo. The primary outcome was the change in pleural opacity, measured as the percentage of the hemithorax occupied by effusion, on chest radiography on day 7 as compared with day 1. Secondary outcomes included referral for surgery, duration of hospital stay, and adverse events. Results: The mean (±SD) change in pleural opacity was greater in the t-PA-DNase group than in the placebo group (-29.5±23.3% vs. -17.2±19.6%; difference, -7.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], -13.4 to -2.4; P=0.005); the change observed with t-PA alone and with DNase alone (-17.2±24.3 and -14.7±16.4%, respectively) was not significantly different from that observed with placebo. The frequency of surgical referral at 3 months was lower in the t-PA-DNase group than in the placebo group (2 of 48 patients [4%] vs. 8 of 51 patients [16%]; odds ratio for surgical referral, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.87; P=0.03) but was greater in the DNase group (18 of 46 patients [39%]) than in the placebo group (odds ratio, 3.56; 95% CI, 1.30 to 9.75; P=0.01). Combined t-PA-DNase therapy was associated with a reduction in the hospital stay, as compared with placebo (difference, -6.7 days; 95% CI, -12.0 to -1.9; P=0.006); the hospital stay with either agent alone was not significantly different from that with placebo. The frequency of adverse events did not differ significantly among the groups. Conclusions: Intrapleural t-PA-DNase therapy improved fluid drainage in patients with pleural infection and reduced the frequency of surgical referral and the duration of the hospital stay. Treatment with DNase alone or t-PA alone was ineffective.",
      "methods": "This double-blind, double-dummy, 2×2 factorial randomized trial (MIST2) was conducted at 11 UK centers from December 2005 to November 2008. Adults with pleural infection were randomized centrally by minimization to one of four treatment groups: t-PA plus DNase, t-PA plus placebo, DNase plus placebo, or double placebo. Doses: intrapleural DNase 5 mg and t-PA 10 mg, each given twice daily for 3 days; chest drains were clamped for 1 hour post-administration. The primary endpoint was the change in the percentage of ipsilateral hemithorax occupied by pleural effusion on chest radiograph from day 1 to day 7, measured digitally by two independent assessors. Secondary endpoints included relative change in opacity, referral for thoracic surgery at 3 and 12 months, hospital length of stay, drained fluid volume to day 7, changes in inflammatory markers to day 7, mortality at 3 and 12 months, and adverse events. Analyses followed a modified intention-to-treat approach excluding patients who received no study medication or had <5% baseline opacity. Continuous outcomes used linear regression; binary outcomes used logistic regression; longitudinal markers used mixed-effects models. All models adjusted for baseline effusion area and minimization factors. A test for interaction between t-PA and DNase preceded factorial analysis; significant interaction led to comparisons of each active group vs double placebo.",
      "results": "A total of 210 participants were randomized: 55 to double placebo, 52 to t-PA only, 51 to DNase only, and 52 to t-PA plus DNase. Six received no study medication and 11 had <5% baseline opacity, leaving 193 in the primary analysis (51 placebo, 48 t-PA, 46 DNase, 48 t-PA-DNase). There was a significant interaction between t-PA and DNase for the primary outcome (P=0.002). The mean change in pleural opacity from day 1 to day 7 was -29.5±23.3% with t-PA-DNase vs -17.2±19.6% with placebo; adjusted difference -7.9% (95% CI, -13.4 to -2.4; P=0.005). t-PA alone (-17.2±24.3%) and DNase alone (-14.7±16.4%) did not differ from placebo. Surgical referral by 3 months occurred in 2/48 (4%) with t-PA-DNase vs 8/51 (16%) with placebo (adjusted OR 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.87; P=0.03). DNase alone increased referrals (18/46 [39%]; OR 3.56; 95% CI, 1.30-9.75; P=0.01), while t-PA alone was not significantly different (3/48 [6%]; OR 0.29; 95% CI, 0.07-1.25; P=0.10). Actual surgery within 90 days occurred in 2/48 (4%) with t-PA-DNase vs 6/51 (12%) with placebo (post hoc OR 0.23; 95% CI, 0.04-1.29; P=0.10). Hospital stay was reduced with t-PA-DNase vs placebo (adjusted mean difference -6.7 days; 95% CI, -12.0 to -1.9; P=0.006). Adverse event frequencies did not differ significantly among groups."
