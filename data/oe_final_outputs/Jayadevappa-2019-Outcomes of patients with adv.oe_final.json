      "abstract": "Background: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with central airway obstruction (CAO) may have better survival on systemic therapy if the airway patency is successfully restored by bronchoscopic interventions. It remains unclear which therapeutic bronchoscopic modality [laser, stenting, external beam radiation, brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT)] used for restoring airway patency positively affects outcomes in these patients. We analyzed the effectiveness of PDT in terms of mortality, and time to subsequent treatments in patients with stage III and IV NSCLC. Methods: Study used Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Medicare linked data. We categorized NSCLC patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2011 and with stage III and IV, into three treatment groups: PDT + radiation ± chemotherapy, non-PDT ablation therapy + radiation ± chemotherapy, and radiation + chemotherapy. We analyzed all-cause and cause-specific mortality using Cox proportional hazard models with an inverse probability weighted propensity score adjustment. Time to subsequent treatment was analyzed using GLM model. Results: For the PDT group, hazard for all-cause and cause-specific mortality was comparable to the radiation + chemotherapy group (HR =1.03, 95% CI: 0.73-1.45; and HR =1.04, 95% CI: 0.71-1.51, respectively). The non-PDT ablation group had higher hazard for all-cause (HR =1.22, 95% CI: 1.13-1.33) and cause-specific mortality (HR =1.10, 95% CI: 1.01-1.20), compared to the radiation + chemotherapy group. The PDT group had longer time to follow-up treatment, compared to non-PDT ablation group. Conclusions: In our exploratory study of stage III and IV NSCLC patients with CAO, addition of PDT demonstrated hazard of mortality comparable to radiation + chemotherapy group. However, addition of non-PDT ablation showed higher mortality compared to the radiation + chemotherapy group. Future studies should investigate the efficacy and effectiveness of multimodal therapy including radiation, chemo, immunotherapy and bronchoscopic interventions.",
      "methods": "SEER-Medicare data from National Cancer Institute link the Medicare administrative claims data and clinical tumor registry data for Medicare enrollees residing in the SEER regions. In this retrospective cohort study, we extracted a cohort of patients aged 18 years or older, and diagnosed with stage III or IV NSCLC between 2000 and 2011. We identified three exclusive treatment groups using ICD-9 and HCPCS codes: PDT + radiation ± chemotherapy, non-PDT ablation (argon plasma coagulation, cryotherapy, laser) + radiation ± chemotherapy, and radiation + chemotherapy. Key outcomes were all-cause and lung cancer-specific mortality, and time to subsequent treatment (for PDT and non-PDT ablation groups). Mortality data were from SEER PEDSF; survivors at end of study (2013-12-31) were censored. We used Cox regression for mortality and GLM for time to subsequent treatment. To address non-random treatment assignment, we implemented inverse probability weighted propensity scores from a multinomial logistic regression including age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, geographic location, cancer stage, and Charlson comorbidity score. A matched cohort analysis (PDT as focal, 1:2 matched on age ±3 years, race, gender, comorbidity) was also performed.",
      "results": "The cohort included 43,783 Medicare enrollees with stage III or IV NSCLC (diagnosed 2000-2011): 39 received PDT + radiation ± chemotherapy, 558 received non-PDT ablation + radiation ± chemotherapy, and 43,186 received radiation + chemotherapy. Unadjusted mean all-cause survival times were 505 days (SD 526) for PDT, 417 days (SD 497) for non-PDT ablation, and 502 days (SD 582) for radiation + chemotherapy. Unadjusted mean time to subsequent treatment was 147 days (SD 295) for PDT vs 98 days (SD 233) for non-PDT ablation (P=0.2048). In inverse probability weighted Cox models, compared with radiation + chemotherapy, PDT had similar all-cause mortality hazard (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.73-1.45) and lung cancer-specific mortality hazard (HR 1.04, 95% CI 0.71-1.51). Non-PDT ablation had higher all-cause mortality hazard (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.13-1.33) and higher lung cancer-specific mortality hazard (HR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01-1.20). In adjusted GLM, PDT was associated with 29.2-day longer time to follow-up treatment on average vs non-PDT ablation (P=0.4458). Matched cohort analyses were directionally consistent."

    "summary_tldr": "In stage III-IV NSCLC Medicare patients, PDT + radiation ± chemotherapy had mortality hazards similar to radiation + chemotherapy, while non-PDT ablation + radiation ± chemotherapy had higher mortality; PDT also showed a nonsignificant 29.2-day longer time to subsequent treatment vs non-PDT ablation.",
    "clinical_relevance": "Findings suggest PDT may offer outcomes comparable to standard radiation + chemotherapy and potentially prolong time to next intervention among patients with endobronchial obstruction."
