      "abstract": "The indications for rigid bronchoscopy for interventional pulmonology have increased and include stent placements and transbronchial cryobiopsy procedures. The shared airway between anesthesiologist and pulmonologist and the open airway system, requiring specific ventilation techniques such as jet ventilation, need a good understanding of the procedure to reduce potentially harmful complications. Appropriate adjustment of the ventilator settings including pause pressure and peak inspiratory pressure reduces the risk of barotrauma. High frequency jet ventilation allows adequate oxygenation and carbon dioxide removal even in cases of tracheal stenosis up to frequencies of around 150 min-1; however, in an in vivo animal model, high frequency jet ventilation along with normal frequency jet ventilation (superimposed high frequency jet ventilation) has been shown to improve oxygenation by increasing lung volume and carbon dioxide removal by increasing tidal volume across a large spectrum of frequencies without increasing barotrauma. General anesthesia with a continuous, intravenous, short-acting agent is safe and effective during rigid bronchoscopy procedures.",
      "methods": "Focused narrative review of jet ventilation during rigid bronchoscopy in adults. The article describes physiology, equipment, ventilator settings and alarms, superimposed high-frequency jet ventilation (SHFJV), reported advantages and complications, and peri-anesthetic management. No systematic search strategy, selection criteria, or quantitative synthesis were reported.",
      "results": "Key points: (1) HFJV delivers small tidal volumes at high frequency with passive expiration; typical settings include driving pressure 0.3-3 bar, frequency 120-600 counts per minute, and inspiration time 0.3-0.4. (2) Two critical alarms include pause pressure with a suggested threshold less than 10 cm H2O and peak inspiratory pressure commonly set near 20 mbar. (3) Effective tracheal FiO2 during open jet ventilation with 100% oxygen is approximately 0.8-0.9 due to entrainment. (4) FiO2 should be below 0.4 during laser procedures. (5) SHFJV (combining low- and high-frequency jets) can improve oxygenation by increasing end-expiratory lung volume and enhance CO2 elimination across a range of frequencies in animal models, and is reported as safe and effective clinically in severe stenosis, with practical emphasis on PIP adjustment when PP is inhibited by some devices. (6) Complications include barotrauma (pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema), hypoxemia, hypercapnia, and hemodynamic instability, with higher risk in airway narrowing and severe lung disease. (7) General anesthesia with short-acting intravenous agents and full neuromuscular blockade is recommended; monitoring may include BIS and transcutaneous CO2."
