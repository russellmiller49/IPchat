      "abstract": "Background The safety and efficacy of transbronchial microwave ablation (TMA) therapy in patients with malignant central airway obstruction (CAO) with respiratory failure remains unclear. Methods A total of 38 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or lung metastases with malignant endoluminal obstruction received TMA therapy under moderate sedation and high fractions of inspired oxygen (FiO2). The success rate of airway patency restoration, complication rate, and overall survival time (OS) from the initiation of TMA therapy were compared in the following two groups of patients with malignant CAO patients: the group with respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300) (RF group, n = 10) and the group without respiratory failure (PaO2/FiO2 > 300) (non-RF group, n = 28) at the time of the TMA therapy. Results Both the RF group and non-RF group received a median of two sessions of TMA. There was no significant difference in the percentage of patients who showed restored airway patency after the first session of TMA (90% vs. 96%), in the complication rate of TMA therapy (10% vs. 11%), or in the OS (7.1 months vs. 9.1 months) between the RF group and the non-RF group. Multivariate analysis identified no significant association between TMA therapy and the risk of death in malignant CAO patients with respiratory failure (p = 0.196). Conclusion TMA therapy under moderate sedation was well tolerated and effective in patients with malignant CAO, including those with respiratory failure.",
      "methods": "This retrospective, single-institution study retrieved data from October 1, 2013, to March 31, 2020, on patients with advanced NSCLC or lung metastases with symptomatic malignant CAO. Of 60 identified patients, 38 with endoluminal obstruction received TMA therapy and were analyzed; patients with extraluminal obstruction received stents. TMA was performed under moderate sedation (midazolam) and high FiO2 after topical lidocaine. Using a microwave tissue coagulator (Microtaze OT-110M or AFM-712) and a long-roller electrode (TE-24BL), tumor was coagulated at 50 watts until blanching; coagulated tissue was removed with biopsy forceps. Success was defined as ≥50% airway patency. Patients were stratified by respiratory failure at TMA (RF: PaO2/FiO2 ≤ 300; non-RF: > 300). Endpoints: airway patency restoration after first TMA session, TMA complication rate, and OS from TMA initiation. Statistics: Mann-Whitney U and Fisher’s exact tests for group comparisons; Kaplan-Meier and log-rank for OS; variables with p < 0.10 entered into Cox regression to estimate HRs and 95% CIs.",
      "results": "Among 38 TMA-treated patients (10 RF; 28 non-RF), median age was 67 vs 73 years. PS 3-4 was more frequent in RF (60% vs 21%; p = 0.045). Airway patency after the first session was restored in 36/38 (95%) overall, specifically 9/10 (90%) RF vs 27/28 (96%) non-RF (p = 0.462). Symptom and/or PS improvement occurred in 8/10 (80%) RF vs 22/28 (79%) non-RF (p = 0.999). Any TMA complication occurred in 1/10 (10%) RF vs 3/28 (11%) non-RF (p = 0.999), including endobronchial bleeding in 1 RF (requiring tracheal intubation) and 1 non-RF (moderate, resolved after second TMA), and airway re-occlusion due to epithelial detachment in 2 non-RF (resolved after bronchoscopic removal). Over median follow-up of 6.0 months (range 0.6-88.0), deaths occurred in 8/10 RF vs 21/28 non-RF. Median OS: 7.1 vs 9.1 months (p = 0.059, log-rank). Post-TMA anticancer therapy improved OS vs best supportive care (31.0 vs 3.5 months; p < 0.0001). In multivariable Cox analysis, airway patency restoration after first TMA (HR 0.139; 95% CI 0.021-0.915; p = 0.040) and receipt of post-TMA anticancer therapy (HR 0.222; 95% CI 0.075-0.653; p = 0.006) were associated with reduced mortality; respiratory failure at TMA was not associated with increased risk of death (p = 0.196)."
