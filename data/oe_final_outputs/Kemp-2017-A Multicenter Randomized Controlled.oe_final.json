      "abstract": "Rationale: Single-center RCTs of Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) treatment have demonstrated benefit in severe heterogeneous emphysema. This is the first multicenter study evaluating this treatment approach. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zephyr EBVs in patients with heterogeneous emphysema and absence of collateral ventilation. Methods: Prospective, multicenter 2:1 RCT of EBVs plus standard of care or standard of care (SoC) alone. Primary outcome at 3 months post-procedure was the percent of subjects with a FEV1 improvement from baseline of ≥12%. Changes in FEV1, RV, 6MWD, SGRQ, and mMRC were assessed at 3 and 6 months, and target lobe volume reduction (TLVR) on chest CT at 3 months. Results: Ninety seven subjects were randomized to EBV (n=65) or SoC (n=32). At 3 months, 55.4% of EBV and 6.5% of SoC subjects had an FEV1 improvement ≥12% (p<0.001). Improvements were maintained at 6 months: EBV 56.3% vs SoC 3.2% (p<0.001), with a mean change in FEV1 at 6 months of 20.7±29.6% and -8.6±13.0%, respectively. 89.8% of EBV subjects had TLVR ≥350ml, mean 1.09±0.62L (p<0.001). Between group differences for changes at 6 months were statistically and clinically significant: ∆EBV-SoC for RV -700ml; 6MWD +78.7m; SGRQ -6.5 points; mMRC Dyspnea score -0.6 points; BODE Index -1.8 points (all p<0.05). Pneumothorax was the commonest adverse event, occurring in 19/65 (29.2%) of EBV subjects. Conclusions: EBV treatment in hyperinflated patients with heterogeneous emphysema without collateral ventilation resulted in clinically meaningful benefits in lung function, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and quality of life, with an acceptable safety profile.",
      "methods": "This randomized, controlled trial (NCT02022683) enrolled patients between June 2014 and June 2016 at 17 sites across Europe. Eligible subjects were ex-smokers ≥40 years of age with severe emphysema. Key inclusion criteria were post-bronchodilator FEV1 15-45% predicted, total lung capacity >100% predicted, residual volume ≥180% predicted, and six-minute walk distance 150-450 m. High-resolution CT scans were quantitatively analyzed to assess lobar volumes and emphysema destruction; heterogeneous emphysema was defined as >10% difference in destruction scores between target and ipsilateral lobes. Collateral ventilation (CV) was assessed using the Chartis system; only CV-negative targets were randomized 2:1 to EBV + standard of care or standard of care alone. EBV placement targeted complete lobar occlusion; EBV subjects had a 45-day CT to assess TLVR with revision bronchoscopy if TLVR <50% or occlusion incomplete. Outcomes were assessed at 3 and 6 months; SoC subjects could cross over after 6 months.",
      "results": "Ninety-seven subjects were randomized to EBV (n=65) or SoC (n=32). At 3 months, 55.4% of EBV vs 6.5% of SoC achieved ≥12% improvement in FEV1 (p<0.001). At 6 months, 56.3% of EBV vs 3.2% of SoC were responders (p<0.001). Mean percent change in FEV1 at 6 months was 20.7±29.6% for EBV and -8.6±13.0% for SoC. Among EBV subjects, 89.8% had TLVR ≥350 mL with mean TLVR 1.09±0.62 L (p<0.001). Between-group differences at 6 months favored EBV: RV -700 mL, 6MWD +78.7 m, SGRQ -6.5 points, mMRC -0.6 points, BODE Index -1.8 points (all p<0.05). Pneumothorax occurred in 19/65 (29.2%) EBV subjects."
