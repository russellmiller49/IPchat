      "abstract": "Intractable advanced lung cancer can be treated palliatively with photodynamic therapy (PDT) combined with chemotherapy to remove central and peripheral (lobar or segmental bronchi) bronchial stenosis and obstruction. We present data for 12 (eight men, four women) consecutive patients with 13 advanced non-small cell lung carcinomas in whom curative operations were contraindicated, who underwent PDT combined with chemotherapy for local control of the intraluminal lesions. The mean age was 73.3 years (range, 58-80 years), and the stages of cancer were IIA-IV. The median stenosis rates before treatment, one week post-treatment, and one month post-treatment were 60% (range, 30%-100%), 15% (range, 15%-99%), and 15% (range 15%-60%), respectively. The mean and median survival times were 9.3 and 5.9 months, respectively. The overall 1-year survival rate was 30.0%. No PDT-related morbidity or mortality occurred. In this single-institution study, all patients experienced improved symptoms and quality of life at one week after treatment; furthermore, an objective response was evidenced by the substantial increase in the openings of the bronchial lumen and prevention of obstructive pneumonia. Therefore, PDT with chemotherapy was useful and safe for the treatment of bronchial obstruction.",
      "methods": "Data were retrospectively collected for 13 lesions of the 12 patients with complicated (e.g., interstitial lung disease) advanced non-small cell lung cancer or endoluminal malignant obstructive lesions who underwent PDT combined with chemotherapy at Niizashiki Central General Hospital between December 2010 and September 2014. Diagnosis was made by bronchoscopy with histopathological confirmation. Photosensitizer: talaporfin sodium (NPe6, Laserphyrin) 40 mg/m2 IV; 4 h later, lesions were irradiated endoscopically at 664 nm using a diode laser. Straight tip: power density 150 mW/cm2, energy 100 J/cm2; radial tip: power density 90-120 mW/cm2, energy 100 J/cm2. The tip was positioned 1-2 cm from the lesion (surface irradiation) or inserted into the tumor (interstitial irradiation). Chemotherapy (platinum-doublet or TS-1) was administered on the day of or the day after PDT. One week and one month after PDT, bronchi and tumor necrosis were evaluated, and combined PDT plus chemotherapy was repeated as indicated. Effectiveness was assessed by symptom relief, bronchoscopic estimation of luminal obstruction (% stenosis), removal of necrotic tumor, CT response per RECIST 1.1 after two cycles, pulmonary function tests in three patients, and Karnofsky score before and one month after treatment. Statistical analyses used paired t-tests for comparisons; Kaplan-Meier for survival; significance p < 0.01.",
      "results": "The median airway stenosis rate improved from 60% (range 30%-100%) before PDT to 15% (range 15%-99%) at 1 week (p = 0.0003) and 15% (range 15%-60%) at 1 month (p = 0.0016). Median Karnofsky score increased from 85 (range 20-100) to 100 (range 90-100) at 1 month. In three patients with pulmonary function tests, median vital capacity increased from 1.93 L to 2.58 L and median FEV1 increased from 1.28 L to 1.67 L two months after PDT. CT responses after two cycles: partial response in 6 patients, stable disease in 3, progressive disease in 3. Mean survival time was 177.5 days (5.9 months); the overall 1-year survival rate was 30.0%. Chemotherapy-related adverse events by CTCAE v4.02 were Grade 1 in 8 patients, Grade 3 in 3 patients, and Grade 4 in 1 patient. No PDT-related morbidity or mortality occurred. All patients had improved symptoms and quality of life at 1 month, with substantial increases in bronchial lumen opening and prevention of obstructive pneumonia."
