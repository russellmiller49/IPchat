      "abstract": "Background: Our previous animal and preliminary human studies indicated that bronchoscopy-guided cooled radio-frequency ablation (RFA) for the lung is a safe and feasible procedure without major complications. Objectives: The present study was performed to evaluate the safety, effectiveness and feasibility of computed tomography (CT)-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA in patients with medically inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Patients with pathologically diagnosed NSCLC, who had no lymph node involvement or distant metastases (T1-2aN0M0) but were not surgical candidates because of comorbidities (e.g. synchronous multiple nodules, advanced age, cardiovascular disease, poor pulmonary function, etc.) were enrolled in the present study. The diagnosis and location between the nearest bronchus and target tumor were made by CT-guided bronchoscopy before the treatment. A total of 28 bronchoscopy-guided cooled RFA procedures were performed in 20 patients. After treatment, serial CT imaging was performed as follow-up. Results: Eleven lesions showed significant reductions in tumor size and 8 lesions showed stability, resulting in a local control rate of 82.6%. The median progression-free survival was 35 months (95% confidence interval: 22-45 months), and the 5-year overall survival was 61.5% (95% confidence interval: 36-87%). Three patients developed an acute ablation-related reaction (fever, chest pain) and required hospitalization but improved with conservative treatment. There were no other adverse events in the present study. Conclusions: CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA is applicable for only highly selected subjects; however, our trial may be an alternative strategy, especially for disease local control in medically inoperable patients with stage I NSCLC.",
      "methods": "This study was conducted according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Institutional Review Board (Shinshu University No. 847). Written informed consent was obtained. Patients with pathologically diagnosed NSCLC (clinical stage T1-2aN0M0) who were medically inoperable or refused surgery were enrolled (July 2006-April 2012). Staging used the sixth TNM edition with thin-slice CT for tumor size/bronchus relationship, contrast-enhanced chest CT for nodal assessment, and abdominal/brain CT, bone scan or FDG-PET for metastasis evaluation. A custom cooled-electrode catheter (10-mm active tip with 5 beads; internal cold-water perfusion 50 ml/min at 4 °C) was connected to a monopolar RF generator with impedance control. Output/temperature limits were 20 W/60 °C until September 2009 and 30 W/70 °C thereafter. RFA was delivered for 50 s per application under spontaneous breathing. Procedures were performed under local anesthesia with flexible bronchoscopy and low-dose CT guidance to position the catheter tip within the tumor (target impedance <300 Ω). RFA was performed 2-3 times per patient; low-dose CT was used 4-5 times focusing on the target. Follow-up CT occurred at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months, then at least every 6 months. Responses were assessed by RECIST; stable disease required at least 6 months of stability. Overall survival (OS) was measured from first RFA to death/last follow-up (patient-level). Progression-free interval (PFI) was measured from first RFA to radiologic progression (lesion-level). Kaplan-Meier methods were used.",
      "results": "Twenty patients (9 men, 11 women; mean age 75.9 years, range 58-88) with 23 lesions were treated by CT-guided bronchoscopy cooled RFA. Histology: 12 adenocarcinomas, 6 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 undifferentiated; some had synchronous lesions. Median tumor size was 24 mm (range 12-45). Initial responses (23 lesions): partial response in 11, stable disease in 8, progressive disease in 4, giving a local tumor control rate of 82.6% (19/23). Local progression occurred in 12 lesions during follow-up; 5 lesions underwent repeat RFA. Additional therapies after progression included radiotherapy/SBRT (3 patients) and chemotherapy (1 patient). Median PFI was 35 months (95% CI 22-45). Five-year OS by Kaplan-Meier in 20 patients was 61.5% (95% CI 36-87). Six patients died: 3 from lung cancer progression (OS 27.5, 40.5, and 50 months), 2 from pneumonia unrelated to lung cancer (OS 5 and 34 months), and 1 from another malignancy (OS 23 months). Safety: no serious intra-procedural toxicities; two patients had transient chest pain during RFA leading to brief pauses. No hypoxemia, arrhythmia, bleeding, or pneumothorax occurred. An acute ablation-related reaction with radiographic consolidation plus fever and chest pain occurred in 3 patients 2-3 days post-procedure, requiring hospitalization; all improved with conservative treatment."
