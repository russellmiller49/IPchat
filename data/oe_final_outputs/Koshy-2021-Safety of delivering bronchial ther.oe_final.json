      "abstract": "Background: Bronchial thermoplasty (BT) is a novel endoscopic therapy for severe asthma. Traditionally it is performed in three separate treatment sessions, targeting different portions of the lung, and each requires an anaesthetic and hospital admission. Compression of treatment into 2 sessions would present a more convenient alternative for patients. In this prospective observational study, the safety of compressing BT into two treatment sessions was compared with the traditional 3 treatment approach. Methods: Sixteen patients meeting ERS/ATS criteria for severe asthma consented to participate in an accelerated treatment schedule (ABT), which treated the whole left lung followed by the right lung four weeks later. The short-term outcomes of these patients were compared with 37 patients treated with conventional BT scheduling (CBT). The outcome measures used to assess safety were (1) the requirement to remain in hospital beyond the electively planned 24-h admission and (2) the need for re-admission for any cause within of 30 days of treatment. Results: The total number of radiofrequency activations delivered in the ABT group was similar to CBT (187 ±21 vs 176 ±40, p =0.326). With ABT, 11 in 31 admissions (37.9%) required prolonged admission due to wheezing, compared to 5.4% with CBT (p =0.0025). The mean hospital length of stay with ABT was 1.8 ±1.3 days, compared to 1.1 ±0.4 days (p < 0.001). ICU monitoring was required on 5 occasions with ABT (16.1%), compared to 0.9% with CBT (p =0.002). Subgroup analysis demonstrated that females were more likely to require prolonged admission (OR 11.6, p =0.0025). The 30-day hospital readmission rate was similar for both groups (6.4% vs 5.4%, p =0.67). All patients made a complete recovery after treatment with similar outcomes at the 6-month follow-up reassessment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that ABT results in greater short-term deterioration in lung function associated with a greater risk of prolonged hospital and ICU stay, predominantly affecting females. Therefore, in females, these risks need to be balanced against the convenience of fewer treatment sessions. In males, it may be an advantage to compress treatment.",
      "methods": "Single-centre, prospective, observational study at a tertiary referral centre. Sixteen patients with severe asthma (ERS/ATS definition) underwent an accelerated, two-session BT schedule (whole left lung then whole right lung 4 weeks later). Outcomes were compared with a historical cohort of 37 patients treated with conventional three-session BT prior to January 2019. All patients received standard peri-procedural steroids (prednisolone 50 mg daily for 3 days pre- and post-procedure), inhaled bronchodilators pre-procedure, and intraoperative dexamethasone and glycopyrrolate. Primary safety outcomes: (1) admission >24 h (prolonged hospital stay) and (2) readmission within 30 days for any cause. Post-bronchodilator FEV1 was measured immediately preoperatively and again at 24 h post-procedure for quantifying short-term change (available for all 16 accelerated patients and for 20 conventional patients). Secondary outcomes at baseline and 6 months post-completion included ACQ-5, exacerbation frequency, medication use, and spirometry. Statistical tests: t-test for normally distributed data, Wilcoxon tests for non-normal data, and Fisher’s exact test for categorical comparisons. Two-tailed significance set at p < 0.05.",
      "results": "In the accelerated group, 15/16 patients completed both sessions (one declined second session). Conventional BT patients (n=37) completed all 111 treatments. Total radiofrequency activations were similar (accelerated 187 ±21 vs conventional 176 ±40, p=0.326). Prolonged stay >24 h occurred in 11/31 accelerated admissions (37.9%) vs 6/111 conventional admissions (5.4%) (p<0.001). Mean hospital length of stay was higher with accelerated BT (1.8 ±1.3 days) vs conventional (1.1 ±0.4 days) (p<0.001). ICU monitoring occurred on 5/31 accelerated admissions (16.1%) vs 1/111 conventional (0.9%) (p=0.002). Two accelerated admissions (6.4%) were readmitted within 30 days (one pneumonia, one non-ischaemic chest pain); readmission rate in conventional group was 5.4% (p=0.670). The mean 24 h fall in FEV1 with accelerated treatment was 403 ±352 ml (22.6 ±16.4%), significantly greater than conventional lower lobe sessions (114 ±243 ml, 5.0 ±15.0%, p=0.001). Subgroup findings indicated a higher risk of prolonged admission among females (pooled OR 11.6, p=0.0025)."
