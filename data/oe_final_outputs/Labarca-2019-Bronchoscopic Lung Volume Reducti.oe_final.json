      "abstract": "Background: Endoscopic lung volume reduction using Zephyr valves has been recently adopted as a treatment option for patients with severe emphysema without collateral ventilation (CV). Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of Zephyr valves in such a population. Methods: Studies were identified from MEDLINE and EMBASE databases. All searches were current until June 2018. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy and safety of Zephyr. We defined as outcome: change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), in the 6-min walking test (6MWT), in the St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and in residual volume (RV). Safety analysis included relative risk (RR) of pneumothorax. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE. Results: 7 RCTs reported on Zephyr valves and 5 RCTs included only patients without CV. Zephyr improved FEV1 with a mean difference (MD) of 17.36% (CI, 9.28-25.45, I2 = 78%). Subgroup analysis showed significant FEV1 improvement following Zephyr placement in patients with heterogeneous distribution: MD = 21.78% (CI, 8.70-34.86, I2 = 89%) and 16.27% (CI, 8.78-23.76, I2 = 0%) in patients with homogeneous emphysema. Studies with a follow-up of 3 months reported FEV1 MD = 17.19% (CI, 3.16-31.22, I2 = 89%) compared to studies with a follow-up of 6-12 months, which showed a consistent improvement of FEV1 MD = 17.90% (CI, 11.47-24.33, I2 = 0%). Zephyr also showed improvement of SGRQ, 6MWT, and RV. RR of pneumothorax was 6.32 (CI, 3.74-10.67, I2 = 0%). Conclusion: In this population, Zephyr valves provided significant and clinically meaningful short-term improvements in either homogeneous or heterogeneous emphysema without CV but with an increase in adverse events.",
      "methods": "This systematic review followed PRISMA. Databases searched included MEDLINE, clinicaltrials.gov, Cochrane Library, Lilacs, and EMBASE through October 2018. Inclusion criteria: adults with COPD stage III-IV and severe emphysema without collateral ventilation measured by Chartis, on optimal medical therapy, randomized to Zephyr endobronchial valves (EBV) versus standard of care or sham; RCTs only. Exclusion criteria included non-severe emphysema, COPD stage I-II or suboptimal medical therapy, prior non-Zephyr interventions, presence of collateral ventilation, and non-RCT designs. Risk of bias used Cochrane tool. Random-effects DerSimonian-Laird meta-analyses were conducted. Continuous outcomes were pooled as mean differences (MD): FEV1 (% predicted), SGRQ (total score), 6MWT (m), RV (mL/L). Safety outcomes included RR of pneumothorax and all-cause mortality. Subgroups examined follow-up (3 vs ≥6 months), emphysema distribution (heterogeneous vs homogeneous), and comparator (sham vs standard of care). Heterogeneity was assessed by I2 and χ2 tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant.",
      "results": "Seven RCTs (n = 987) met inclusion for qualitative synthesis; five RCTs enrolling only patients without collateral ventilation were included in quantitative synthesis. Pooled FEV1 % predicted improved by MD 17.36 (95% CI 9.28-25.45; I2 = 78%; total EBV n = 295; control n = 203); overall effect Z = 4.21, p = 0.001. Subgroup by emphysema distribution: homogeneous MD 16.27 (95% CI 8.78-23.76; I2 = 0%; Z = 4.26, p < 0.0001); heterogeneous MD 21.78 (95% CI 8.70-34.86; I2 = 89%; Z = 3.26, p = 0.001). Follow-up subgroup: 3 months MD 17.19 (95% CI 3.16-31.22; I2 = 89%); 6-12 months MD 17.90 (95% CI 11.47-24.33; I2 = 0%). SGRQ improved (e.g., 6-12 months MD -9.14, 95% CI -13.16 to -5.11). 6MWT improved (e.g., 6-12 months MD 59.96 m, 95% CI 44.23-75.69). RV reduced (e.g., 6-12 months MD -0.53 L, 95% CI -0.67 to -0.40). Pneumothorax risk increased with RR 6.32 (95% CI 3.74-10.67; I2 = 0%)."
