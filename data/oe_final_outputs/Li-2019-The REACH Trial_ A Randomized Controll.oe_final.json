      "abstract": "Background: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) has become a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in China, with tobacco smoke, air pollution, and occupational biohazards being the major risk factors. Objectives: The REACH trial is a multicenter, prospective, randomized controlled trial undertaken in China to assess the safety and effectiveness of the Spiration Valve System (SVS) compared to standard medical care in COPD patients with severe emphysema. Methods: Patients with severe airflow obstruction, hyperinflation, and severe dyspnea with interlobar fissure integrity were evaluated for enrollment. A total of 107 subjects were randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to either the treatment group (SVS valves and medical management) or the control group (medical management alone). Results: The 3-month primary endpoint showed statistically significant improvement in forced expiratory volume in 1 s in the treatment group compared to the control group (0.104 ± 0.18 vs. 0.003 ± 0.15 L, p = 0.001), with the difference being durable through 6 months. Statistically significant target lobe volume reduction was achieved at 3 months (mean change 684.4 ± 686.7 mL) and through 6 months (757.0 ± 665.3 mL). Exercise function and quality of life measures improved in the treatment group, but showed a deterioration in the control group. The serious adverse event (SAE) rate was 33% in the treatment group and 24.2% in the control group. The predominance of SAEs were acute exacerbations of COPD in both groups. There was 1 death in the control group and no deaths in the treatment group. Conclusion: The SVS represents a novel approach for the treatment of severe emphysema with a clinically acceptable risk-benefit profile.",
      "methods": "REACH is a prospective, multicenter, unblinded, randomized, parallel assignment study at 12 clinical sites in China, comparing SVS plus medical management versus medical management alone with a 2:1 allocation. Patients had severe dyspnea (mMRC ≥2), severe airflow obstruction (post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≤45% predicted), and hyperinflation (TLC ≥100% and RV ≥150% predicted). HRCT required a target lobe with ≥40% emphysema, ≥15% heterogeneity versus the ipsilateral lobe, and fissure integrity ≥90%. Visual CT eligibility was adjudicated by the lead site and a core lab, with arbitration by QCT (Apollo; VIDA) using -920 HU when needed. Randomization used site-stratified, permuted blocks of 6 via opaque, sealed envelopes maintained by site coordinators. SVS valves (5, 6, or 7 mm) were placed by flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia; prophylactic antibiotics and optional periprocedural corticosteroids were used. Total lobar occlusion was targeted; valve number was unrestricted and replacement allowed. Minimum post-procedure hospitalization was 3 nights. Follow-up occurred at 1, 3 (primary endpoint), 6, and 12 months; HRCT follow-up was performed only in the treatment arm. If gains were less than expected, re-bronchoscopy after 1 month was permitted. Statistical analysis used normality assessment (Kolmogorov-Smirnov), followed by Student’s t test or Mann-Whitney U for continuous data, and Fisher’s exact or Pearson’s χ2 for categorical data; significance level 0.05. Missing data for subjects with at least one follow-up were handled with last observation carried forward.",
      "results": "295 patients were screened; 107 were randomized. Seven withdrew consent prior to procedure (5 treatment, 2 control), and 1 treatment patient was excluded due to lung cancer, leaving 66 treatment and 33 control participants. All SVS procedures used general anesthesia; mean procedure time was 52.0 ± 18.6 min; mean 5.2 ± 1.1 valves per procedure; mean hospital stay 6.3 days. The primary endpoint showed greater FEV1 improvement at 3 months in treatment vs control (0.104 ± 0.178 L, n=63 vs 0.003 ± 0.147 L, n=32; p = 0.001), with differences maintained at 6 months (0.091 ± 0.156 L, n=63 vs -0.024 ± 0.142 L, n=33; p < 0.001). TLVR in the treatment arm was 684.4 ± 686.7 mL at 3 months and 757.0 ± 665.3 mL at 6 months. FEV1 responder rates (≥15% improvement) were higher in treatment vs control at 1, 3, and 6 months (49% vs 22%; 48% vs 13%; 41% vs 21%). The SAE rate was 33% in treatment and 24.2% in control; acute COPD exacerbations predominated. There was 1 death in the control group and none in the treatment group."
