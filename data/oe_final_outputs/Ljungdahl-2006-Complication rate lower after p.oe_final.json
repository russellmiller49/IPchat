      "abstract": "Background: Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has increasingly replaced surgical gastrostomy (SG) as the primary procedure for the long-term nutrition of patients with swallowing disorders. This prospective randomized study compares PEG with SG in terms of effectiveness and safety. Methods: This study enrolled 70 patients with swallowing disorders, mainly attributable to neurologic impairment. All the patients, eligible for both techniques, were randomized to PEG (pull method) or SG. The groups were comparable in terms of age, body mass index, and underlying diseases. Complications were reported 7 and 30 days after the operative procedure. Results: The procedures were successfully completed for all the patients. The median operative time was 15 min for PEG and 35 min for SG (p < 0.001). The rate of complications was lower for PEG (42.9%) than for SG (74.3%; p < 0.01). The 30-day mortality rates were 5.7% for PEG and 14.3% for SG (nonsignificant difference). Conclusion: The findings show PEG to be an efficient method for gastrostomy tube placement with a lower complication rate than SG. In addition, PEG is faster to perform and requires fewer medical resources. The authors consider PEG to be the primary procedure for gastrostomy tube placement.",
      "methods": "The Research Ethics Committee at Uppsala University approved the study. During 45 months, patients with impaired swallowing and a need for long-term (>4 weeks) enteral feeding were screened. Inclusion required feasibility of both PEG and SG; exclusions were prior upper GI surgery and inability to undergo endoscopy due to pharyngoesophageal obstruction. Two refused participation. Seventy patients were randomized by sealed envelopes (non-stratified) to PEG (n=35) or SG (n=35). Preoperative antibiotics (cefuroxime 1.5 g IV) were given. PEG (pull technique) was performed under light sedation with endoscopic guidance using 20-22 Fr catheters. SG was performed via a short upper midline incision with a 22 Fr tube and gastric fixation. Feeding was started after 24 hours. Outcomes included procedure duration, technical success, and complications assessed daily and recorded at days 7 and 30; complications were classified as early (days 1-7) or late (days 8-30); wound infection required ≥2 of erythema, induration, or purulent discharge. Mortality was followed ≥6 months. Statistics used ANOVA and Student’s t-test for group differences and chi-square for 30-day mortality; p<0.05 was significant.",
      "results": "All planned procedures were completed without perioperative complications. Median operative time was 15 min (9-31) for PEG and 35 min (20-65) for SG (p<0.001). For SG, total time in the operating theater (induction, operation, awakening) was 85 min (45-125). No perioperative mortality occurred. In PEG, two patients died within 30 days (GI hemorrhage day 2 deemed procedure-related; recurrent stroke day 9), 30-day mortality 5.7%. One PEG patient had local peritonitis treated conservatively. Twelve PEG patients (34%) had minor complications. In SG, 30-day mortality was 14.3% (two aspiration pneumonia; three progression of underlying disease). Two additional SG patients developed pneumonia treated with antibiotics (major complication). Nineteen SG patients (54%) had minor gastrostomy-site complications; tube dislodgement occurred in six (four easily replaced, two required reoperation). Patients with any complication were fewer in PEG (13/35) than SG (25/35) (p<0.01; table p=0.003)."
