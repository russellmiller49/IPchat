      "abstract": "The ACR created the Lung CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) in 2014 to standardize the reporting and management of screen-detected pulmonary nodules. Lung-RADS was updated to version 1.1 in 2019 and revised size thresholds for nonsolid nodules, added classification criteria for perifissural nodules, and allowed for short-interval follow-up of rapidly enlarging nodules that may be infectious in etiology. Lung-RADS v2022, released in November 2022, provides several updates including guidance on the classification and management of atypical pulmonary cysts, juxtapleural nodules, airway-centered nodules, and potentially infectious findings. This new release also provides clarification for determining nodule growth and introduces stepped management for nodules that are stable or decreasing in size. This article summarizes the current evidence and expert consensus supporting Lung-RADS v2022.",
      "methods": "Narrative review and expert consensus by the ACR Lung-RADS Committee. The committee conducted targeted literature reviews for key topics (atypical pulmonary cysts, juxtapleural nodules, infectious/inflammatory findings, airway nodules, growth definitions, stepped management, and interval diagnostic CTs). Where evidence was sufficient, recommendations were evidence-based; where evidence was limited, consensus was reached using nominal group methodology.",
      "results": "Lung-RADS v2022 introduces new classification and management recommendations for atypical pulmonary cysts (thick-walled and multilocular), expands benign criteria to include juxtapleural nodules across pleural locations with benign morphology and size thresholds, updates handling of potentially infectious/inflammatory findings with short-interval follow-up, refines airway nodule categorization, clarifies growth as an increase greater than 1.5 mm in mean diameter within a 12-month interval, defines slow-growing nodules with management steps, adds guidance for use of the S modifier, and provides a stepped management approach for stable or decreasing category 3 and 4A nodules. The Risk of Malignancy column is removed from the table due to lesion-specific variability and limited utility outside category 4B."
