      "abstract": "Background: Spiration Valve System (SVS) is an alternative for patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema; however, data about efficacy from randomized controlled trials (RCT) are unclear. Objectives: To explore both efficacy and safety of SVS in patients with severe emphysema and hyperinflation. Methods: We included PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane database. All searches were performed until August 2019. Only RCTs were included for analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis evaluated change in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), 6-min walking test (6MWT), residual volume, modified medical research council (mMRC) and Saint George respiratory questionnaire (SGRQ), all-cause mortality, risk of pneumothorax, and risk of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Quality of the evidence was rated using GRADE approach. Results: Four RCTs including 629 subjects were included. SVS showed an overall change of 0.03 L (-0.07 to 0.13, I2 = 90%) in the in FEV1 (L) and a 2.03% (-2.50 to 6.57, I2 = 96%) in the predicted FEV1 (%) compared to baseline; however, studies without collateral ventilation (CV) showed an improvement of 0.12 L (95% CI 0.09-0.015, I2 = 0%), This subgroup also reported better results in SGRQ -12.27 points (95% CI -15.84 to -8.70, I2 = 0%) and mMRC -0.54 (95% CI -0.74 to -0.33, I2 = 0%). We found no benefit in 6MWT mean difference = 4.56 m (95% CI -21.88 to 31.00, I2 = 73%). Relative risk of mortality was 2.54 (95% CI 0.81-7.96, I2 = 0%), for pneumothorax 3.3 (95% CI 0.61-18.12, I2 = 0%) and AECOPD 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.70, I2 = 0%). Conclusion: In patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation without CV, SVS is an alternative that showed an improvement in pulmonary function, quality of life, and dyspnea score with an acceptable risk profile.",
      "methods": "Systematic review and random-effects meta-analysis of RCTs following PRISMA and Cochrane Handbook guidance. Databases searched in August 2019 included MEDLINE, Lilacs, Trip Database, Directory of Open Access Journals, Cochrane database, and Epistemonikos; conference proceedings from ERS, ATS, and CHEST (2014-2018) were also searched. Inclusion: adult COPD with severe heterogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation by HRCT and PFT; intervention: Spiration Valve System; comparator: optimized standard of care; outcomes: FEV1 (L and % predicted), RV, SGRQ, mMRC, 6MWT, all-cause mortality, pneumothorax, AECOPD. Only RCTs were included. Data were pooled using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2. Prespecified subgroup analyses: collateral ventilation status (by HRCT fissure completeness), risk of bias, and follow-up time (3, 6, 12 months). Quality assessed with GRADE.",
      "results": "Four multicenter parallel-group RCTs (n = 629; SVS n = 364, control n = 265) were included. Overall FEV1 (L) MD was 0.03 (95% CI -0.07 to 0.13; I2 = 90%; Z = 0.61; p = 0.54). Predicted FEV1 (%) MD was 2.03 (95% CI -2.50 to 6.57; I2 = 96%). In no-collateral-ventilation subgroups, FEV1 (L) MD was 0.12 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.15; I2 = 0%); SGRQ MD -12.27 (95% CI -15.84 to -8.70; I2 = 0%); mMRC MD -0.54 (95% CI -0.74 to -0.33; I2 = 0%). Overall SGRQ MD -6.50 (95% CI -16.05 to 3.04; I2 = 94%). mMRC overall MD -0.33 (95% CI -0.61 to -0.05; I2 = 65%). 6MWT MD 4.56 m (95% CI -21.88 to 31.00; I2 = 73%). At 12 months, FEV1 (L) MD 0.10 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.15); SGRQ MD -9.50 (95% CI -13.66 to -5.34); mMRC MD -0.80 (95% CI -1.05 to -0.55). Safety meta-analytic RRs: mortality 2.54 (95% CI 0.81-7.96; I2 = 0%), pneumothorax 3.33 (95% CI 0.61-18.12; I2 = 0%), AECOPD 1.68 (95% CI 1.04-2.70; I2 = 0%)."
