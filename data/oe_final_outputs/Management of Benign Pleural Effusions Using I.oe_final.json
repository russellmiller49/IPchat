      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The indwelling pleural catheter (IPC), which was initially introduced for the management of recurrent malignant effusions, could be a valuable management option for recurrent benign pleural effusion (BPE), replacing chemical pleurodesis. The purpose of this study is to analyze the efficacy and safety of IPC use in the management of refractory nonmalignant effusions. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the published literature. Retrospective cohort studies, case series, and reports that used IPCs for the management of pleural effusion were included in the study. RESULTS: Thirteen studies were included in the analysis, with a total of 325 patients. Congestive heart failure (49.8%) was the most common cause of BPE requiring IPC placement. The estimated average rate of spontaneous pleurodesis was 51.3% (95% CI, 37.1%-65.6%). The estimated average rate of all complications was 17.2% (95% CI, 9.8%-24.5%) for the entire group. The estimated average rate of major complications included the following: empyema, 2.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.7%); loculation, 2.0% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.7%); dislodgement, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.7%); leakage, 1.3% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.5%); and pneumothorax, 1.2% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.1%). The estimated average rate of minor complications included the following: skin infection, 2.7% (95% CI, 0.6%-4.9%); blockage and drainage failure, 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0%-3.5%); subcutaneous emphysema, 1.1% (95% CI, 0.0%-4.0%); and other, 2.5% (95% CI, 0.0%-5.2%). One death was directly related to IPC use. CONCLUSIONS: IPCs are an effective and viable option in the management of patients with refractory BPE. The quality of evidence to support IPC use for BPE remains low, and high-quality studies such as randomized controlled trials are needed.",
      "methods": "A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Cochrane database, EMBASE, and MEDLINE from January 2011 to January 2016 to identify reports of IPC use for benign pleural effusions. Inclusion criteria: case series using IPC for BPE regardless of cause, reported follow-up, and outcomes. Retrospective cohort studies, case series, and abstracts were eligible. Exclusion criteria: non-English, no follow-up or outcomes, reviews, single case reports, editorials, malignant etiologies mixed without separable data, and post-lung-transplant populations. Primary outcome was spontaneous pleurodesis defined as drainage < 50 mL on three consecutive IPC drainage procedures with no significant effusion on imaging and no recurrence after catheter removal. Secondary outcomes included time to pleurodesis, complication rates, and additional pleural procedures. Complications were classified as major (requiring removal/replacement, serious infection, pneumothorax, or additional invasive procedures) or minor (managed conservatively without invasive intervention). Study-specific rates used 95% CIs via Jeffreys Prior. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed with 95% prediction intervals; heterogeneity was assessed with Q and I2. Publication bias was assessed via funnel plots and Egger test. Analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4 at alpha 0.05.",
      "results": "Thirteen studies totaling 325 adult patients were included. Cardiac causes accounted for 162/325 (49.8%); other causes included hepatic disease 40 (12.3%), chylothorax 11 (3.4%), empyema 9 (2.8%), inflammatory pleurisy 21 (6.5%), renal disease 13 (4.0%), yellow nail syndrome 5 (1.5%), and others 64 (19.7%). A total of 350 IPCs were placed. Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 160/325 patients; the pooled estimated average rate was 51.3% (95% CI, 37.1%-65.6%; I2 87.2%; Q 93.8; P < .001). Subgroup pooled pleurodesis rates were 42.1% (95% CI, 20.1%-64.1%) for cardiac causes and 61.4% (95% CI, 45.3%-77.4%) for noncardiac causes; the difference was not statistically significant (OR 0.457; P = .165). Time to pleurodesis was variably reported (means and medians) and was not meta-analyzed. Eighty-four additional pleural procedures were reported post-IPC. In a comparative cohort (Freeman et al.), IPC vs thoracoscopy/talc pleurodesis was associated with shorter hospital stay (2 vs 6 days) and lower readmission rates (5% vs 23%). The pooled overall complication rate was 17.2% (95% CI, 9.8%-24.5%). Reported major complications included nine empyemas (three required IPC removal; one death due to sepsis) and six pneumothoraces (none required large-bore chest tubes). Minor complications included eight insertion-site local skin infections treated conservatively. Thirty-seven catheters were removed due to complications (8 detailed; 29 unspecified)."
