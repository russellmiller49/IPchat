      "abstract": "Background: This guideline, a collaborative effort from the American Thoracic Society, Society of Thoracic Surgeons, and Society of Thoracic Radiology, aims to provide evidence-based recommendations to guide contemporary management of patients with a malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Methods: A multidisciplinary panel developed seven PICO questions and used GRADE and an Evidence-to-Decision framework. Results: The panel made conditional recommendations favoring ultrasound guidance for pleural interventions; avoiding pleural drainage in asymptomatic MPE; using either indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or chemical pleurodesis in symptomatic patients with suspected expandable lung; performing large-volume thoracentesis to assess symptomatic response and lung expansion; using either talc poudrage or talc slurry for pleurodesis; using IPC over pleurodesis for nonexpandable lung, failed pleurodesis, or loculations; and treating IPC-associated infections with antibiotics without routine catheter removal. Conclusions: These recommendations can guide management of MPE to improve patient-centered outcomes.",
      "methods": "The panel applied the GRADE approach to seven PICO questions covering diagnostic guidance, indications for drainage, procedural sequencing, choice of definitive intervention, talc administration method, management in nonexpandable lung, and management of IPC-associated infections. Evidence synthesis incorporated existing systematic reviews and new systematic reviews (including a dedicated review for PICO 4), with judgments on certainty and strength of recommendations through the Evidence-to-Decision framework.",
      "results": "Key evidence included observational comparative data showing reduced pneumothorax with ultrasound guidance during thoracentesis, retrospective cohorts suggesting asymptomatic small MPEs rarely require intervention, and randomized and nonrandomized comparative trials informing the choice between IPC and pleurodesis, as well as talc poudrage versus slurry in the context of expandable lung. For nonexpandable lung, evidence supported IPCs over pleurodesis. For IPC-associated infections, case series indicated most infections can be managed with antibiotics without catheter removal."
