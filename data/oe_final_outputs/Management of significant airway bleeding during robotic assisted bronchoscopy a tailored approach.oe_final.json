      "abstract": "Robotic assisted bronchoscopy represents a major turning point in bronchoscopic history. The management strategies to address significant airway bleeding in this “robotic era” are not well documented, and further guidance is required. We present a case report that exemplifies our approach and management strategy using a combined and simultaneous flexible/robotic bronchoscopy if this complication is encountered.",
      "methods": "Single-patient case report of significant airway bleeding (SAB) during robotic assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) for a left upper lobe peripheral lesion. RAB performed under general anesthesia via size 8 endotracheal tube with paralytics, alveolar recruitment, and PEEP of 10. Navigation used Fiber Optic RealShape technology and radial ultrasound confirmation followed by 21-G needle-pass sampling under fluoroscopy. Upon SAB, continuous suction was applied to the proximal robotic catheter while a 4.0-mm flexible bronchoscope (FB) with 2.0-mm working channel was inserted parallel to the endotracheal tube. The ET cuff was partially deflated and the FB advanced into the distal trachea and the left mainstem to the bleeding segment. Hemostatic measures included cold saline and diluted epinephrine instillation. After bleeding control, the robotic scope was slowly retracted under FB visualization; the FB was advanced for confirmation of hemostasis and suction of clots, followed by complete airway clearance. The robotic scope was then reinserted to continue RAB. A stepwise protocol is summarized: (1) continuous suction via robotic catheter; (2) insert 4.0-mm FB via nose or mouth; (3) advance FB through vocal cords and ET; (4) partially deflate ET cuff and advance FB to target segment; (5) do not retract the robotic bronchoscope; (6) apply cold saline, diluted epinephrine 1:10,000, 5-Fr Fogarty balloon, or other hemostatic agents via FB; (7) once controlled, retract robotic scope slowly under FB visualization; (8) suction or cryoextract remaining clots.",
      "results": "Bleeding was noted traveling proximally along the robotic catheter and on fluoroscopy after needle sampling. Combined, simultaneous flexible/robotic bronchoscopy controlled the bleeding with ice cold saline and epinephrine. Hemostasis was confirmed bronchoscopically; clots were cleared; the robotic scope was reinserted and the procedure completed, including systematic mediastinal staging with EBUS. No pneumothorax, worsening hypoxemia, or other complications occurred. The patient was discharged home; pathology was nonmalignant; follow-up CT was planned in 3 months."
