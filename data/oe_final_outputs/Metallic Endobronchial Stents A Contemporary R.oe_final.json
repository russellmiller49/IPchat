      "abstract": "Airway stenting has been practiced for several decades. It is one of the most common procedures performed by interventional pulmonologists. Typically, these stents are implanted to maintain the tubular patency of the tracheobronchial tree. They are only considered as a temporizing measure, or when a surgical option cannot be pursued. Through the past several decades, a number of metallic airway stents have been introduced into the market. First generation stents were comparatively simplistic and crafted from stainless steel. The latest generation of metallic airway stents are hybrid in nature and constructed with complex alloys. As airway stenting become more widely practiced, concerns arose regarding their safety. However, with improved understanding of stent-airway interactions, advancements in biomedical engineering, and a larger emphasis on post procedural care, the use of metallic endobronchial stents has been resurrected. We present the history, technological advancement, and contemporary indications of metallic airway stents.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of the literature and device evolution; no predefined systematic search or randomized comparisons are reported. The article summarizes historical stent designs, biophysical considerations, complications, and contemporary devices with illustrative case series.",
      "results": "Early generation metallic airway stents (Gianturco Z-stent, Wallstent) were associated with substantial late complications (migration, granulation, secretions retention), including one reported fatality in an early series of 55 patients. Second-generation devices (Palmaz, Strecker, AERO, Ultraflex, Dynamic Y) and third-generation nitinol-based hybrid stents (Bonastent, Silmet, Hanarostent, Carina-Y) showed improved deliverability and safety profiles in small series, though migration, mucus retention, and tissue overgrowth remain concerns. In a 12-patient Palmaz series, technical success was 100% with 10 patients improving clinically and 5 deaths reported (unrelated to the stent). In a 3-patient AERO series (6 stents), 5/6 stents migrated and all 6/6 stents developed thick mucus buildup; strictures recurred in all 3/3 patients. For the Dynamic Y stent, among 135 patients followed 3 months, 2 deaths due to hemoptysis and 4 migrations were reported. For Silmet, in 52 patients, technical success occurred in 51/52 and radiographic improvement in 25/52; tumor overgrowth and migration were reported as percentages without exact counts."
