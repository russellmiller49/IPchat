      "abstract": "Background—Airway bleeding, either spontaneous or as a result of bronchoscopy, is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Multiple bronchoscopic techniques are available to achieve complete hemostasis or as a bridge to definitive therapies. Methods—We report our experience on the feasibility of endobronchial instillation of an absorbable gelatin and thrombin slurry (GTS) for the treatment of spontaneous hemoptysis and procedure-related bleeding. Results—We identified thirteen cases in which GTS was used for endobronchial hemostasis when standard bronchoscopic measures like cold saline, epinephrine and in some cases balloon occlusion were not successful. GTS was delivered through the working channel of the bronchoscope in ten cases and through the distal port of a bronchial blocker in the remaining three. Median age was 69 years (range 52 to 79 years). Eight cases corresponded to spontaneous hemoptysis and five cases to diagnostic or therapeutic procedures. Bleeding was considered severe in nine (70%) cases. All but one case were associated with malignancy. Hemostasis was achieved in ten (77%) cases by using standard measures in addition to GTS. No patient adverse events at 30 days or damage to the equipment were identified. Conclusion—Bronchoscopic instillation of an absorbable gelatin and thrombin slurry is feasible and may be used in cases of spontaneous or procedure-related bleeding in addition to conventional measures. It can be delivered through the working channel of the bronchoscope or through the distal port available in some bronchial blockers. Controlled studies are necessary to determine the safety and efficacy of this novel technique.",
      "methods": "After obtaining IRB/Privacy Board approval (WA0109-15), the institutional operating and endoscopy room database at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was screened from January 2010 to April 2017 for bronchoscopic procedures performed by the Pulmonary or Thoracic Surgery services using the keyword “Gelfoam plus.” Patient consent was waived based on the retrospective nature. Bronchoscopy reports, operating room and anesthesia records, and progress notes were reviewed. Airway bleeding was classified as mild (<20 mL/24 h), moderate (20-100 mL/24 h), or severe (>100 mL/24 h; or associated with hemodynamic compromise, respiratory failure, or persistence despite standard bronchoscopic measures including tamponade, epinephrine, cold saline, and/or balloon occlusion; and per bronchoscopist discretion based on bleeding rate). Hemostasis was defined as cessation of bleeding bronchoscopically without need for post-bronchoscopic balloon occlusion with an inflated balloon, immediate angioembolization, or surgery. Patients were followed up to 30 days for adverse events attributed to GTS instillation, recurrence of bleeding (spontaneous hemoptysis or fresh blood in endotracheal tube), and cause of death. GTS was prepared from the GELFOAM PLUS kit (absorbable gelatin and lyophilized thrombin) immediately before administration (approximately 1-2 minutes to reconstitute), and instilled through the bronchoscope working channel or via the distal port of a bronchial blocker; epinephrine solution (1:10,000 to 1:50,000) was used to assure delivery. Balloon occlusion could be used concomitantly.",
      "results": "Thirteen uses of GTS (June 2010 to April 2017) were identified; one patient received GTS on two separate occasions. Median age was 69 years (range 52-79); six female and seven male. Eight cases had spontaneous bleeding (one surgical stump, others malignant airway disease); five were procedure-related (tumor debulking, transbronchial lung biopsy, or contact with endobronchial mass). Bleeding severity: severe in nine (70%), moderate in two (15%), mild in two (15%). No patient was on therapeutic anticoagulation and no significant coagulopathy was recorded. GTS was delivered via a bronchial blocker distal port in three cases; via bronchoscope working channel in ten cases; four of these had concomitant Fogarty balloon occlusion. Hemostasis was achieved bronchoscopically in ten cases (77%); two had a preemptive bronchial blocker left deflated. Additional measures included epinephrine in eleven cases (84%), and tamponade with embolectomy balloon and/or bronchial blocker in nine cases (70%). Two cases used oxidized cellulose polymer; two used more than one Gelfoam Plus kit. Recurrence of bleeding occurred in five of ten cases (50%) with initial hemostasis; only one required an additional therapeutic bronchoscopy. Failure to achieve hemostasis occurred in three cases (23%): all required post-bronchoscopy bronchial balloon occlusion; two required embolization; one resolved spontaneously. No patients required surgery. Three patients died within 30 days (two in the hemostasis group, one in the failure group with evident recurrent contributory bleeding); all deaths related to underlying malignancy. No complications attributable to GTS were identified at 30 days (no post-obstructive pneumonia, respiratory failure due to obstruction, dislodgement of GTS clot, or removal difficulty). No damage to bronchoscopy equipment was encountered."
