      "abstract": "Operating room fires are rare but devastating events. Guidelines are available for the prevention and management of surgical fires; however, these recommendations are based on expert opinion and case series. The three components of an operating room fire are present in virtually all surgical procedures: an oxidizer (oxygen, nitrous oxide), an ignition source (i.e., laser, “Bovie”), and a fuel. This review analyzes each fire ingredient to determine the optimal clinical strategy to reduce the risk of fire. Surgical checklists, team training, and the specific management of an operating room fire are also reviewed.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of the literature and expert guidance on operating room fires, organized around the fire triangle: oxidizer, ignition source, and fuel. The review synthesizes data from bench experiments, observational claims analyses, regulatory advisories, and professional society recommendations. It includes a benchtop comparative test of alcohol-based versus non-alcohol-based skin preparations with standardized monopolar electrosurgery activation.",
      "results": "Key quantitative findings summarized in the review include: (1) Operating room fires occur at least 650 times annually, with 2-3 patient deaths per year; most occur in the head/neck/upper chest (85%) and during monitored anesthesia care (81%). (2) Local oxygen concentration can exceed 35-50% under surgical drapes with open oxygen delivery at 6 L/min; nasal cannula flows can produce up to 60-70% local oxygen concentrations at higher flow rates. (3) In a benchtop experiment comparing skin preps, alcohol-based prep ignited in 13/60 samples with no drying versus 0/40 with non-alcohol-based prep (p<0.001), and 6/60 versus 0/40 after 3 minutes of drying (p=0.08), using a 2-second activation of a monopolar electrosurgical pencil. (4) Lasers can ignite endotracheal tubes in under 2 seconds in 100% oxygen. (5) Closed systems and mitigation strategies (e.g., FiO2 ≤30% with open delivery, open draping, suctioning under drapes, CO2 flooding, saline-soaked gauze) reduce fire risk."
