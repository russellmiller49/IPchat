      "abstract": "Background: Malignant pleural effusions (MPEs) are a frequent cause of dyspnea in patients with cancer. Although indwelling pleural catheters (IPCs) have been used since 1997, there are no studies of quality-adjusted survival following IPC placement. Methods: With a standardized algorithm, this prospective observational cohort study of patients with MPE treated with IPCs assessed global health-related quality of life using the SF-6D to calculate utilities. Quality-adjusted life days (QALDs) were calculated by integrating utilities over time. Results: A total of 266 patients were enrolled. Median quality-adjusted survival was 95.1 QALDs. Dyspnea improved significantly following IPC placement (P < .001), but utility increased only modestly. Patients who had chemotherapy or radiation after IPC placement (P < .001) and those who were more short of breath at baseline (P = .005) had greater improvements in utility. In a competing risk model, the 1-year cumulative incidence of events was death with IPC in place, 35.7%; IPC removal due to decreased drainage, 51.9%; and IPC removal due to complications, 7.3%. Recurrent MPE requiring repeat intervention occurred in 14% of patients whose IPC was removed. Recurrence was more common when IPC removal was due to complications (P = .04) or malfunction (P < .001) rather than to decreased drainage. Conclusions: IPC placement has significant beneficial effects in selected patient populations. The determinants of quality-adjusted survival in patients with MPE are complex. Although dyspnea is one of them, receiving treatment after IPC placement is also important. Future research should use patient-centered outcomes in addition to time-to-event analysis. Trial registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT01117740.",
      "methods": "Prospective observational cohort at a single cancer center (April 2010-January 2013). Inclusion: age ≥18 years, capacity to complete SF-6D and Borg questionnaires, willingness for ≥1 year follow-up. Exclusion: prior pleurodesis, prior IPC, chylous effusion, pleural space infection, bilateral effusions requiring intervention, or mechanical ventilation. MPE defined per TIME2 criteria; subclassified as pathology-proven or clinically diagnosed MPE. All patients received ultrasound-guided PleurX IPC with standardized drainage and management algorithms. Follow-up at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, then monthly. Outcomes: SF-6D utilities (quality-adjusted survival in QALDs), Borg dyspnea, ECOG performance status, complications, catheter removals (elective due to decreased drainage vs due to complication), and recurrent effusion requiring intervention after removal. Statistics: Paired t tests for baseline vs 1-month utilities and Borg; generalized linear model for predictors of utility change; QALDs computed as area under the utility curve; Kaplan-Meier for median QALDs and overall survival; Cox models (extended, time-dependent covariates) for time-to-event outcomes; competing risks for death without removal, removal due to decreased drainage, and removal due to complications. LOCF used for missing repeated measures. SAS 9.3, S-Plus 8.2, and R (CMPRSK).",
      "results": "266 patients enrolled (196 pathology-proven MPE; 70 clinical diagnosis). Median QALDs 95.1 (95% CI 73.3-116.5). Utility did not significantly improve at 1 month vs baseline (difference 0.023; 95% CI -0.004 to 0.05; P = .10). Dyspnea improved substantially (Borg difference -2.31; 95% CI -2.66 to -1.95; P < .0001). Greater utility improvements were seen in those receiving chemotherapy/radiation after IPC (P < .001) and with higher baseline Borg (P = .005). Overall survival: 156/266 died; median 171 days (95% CI 130-192). Quality of life and lower dyspnea burden associated with longer survival; per 0.1 utility increase, death risk decreased by 36% (P < .001). Complications occurred in 26/266 patients (31 events total); 15/266 (5.6%) required IPC removal. Median time to any complication 1.4 months. IPC removal occurred in 148/266 (55.6%): decreased drainage 127, complication 15, other 6. Among those removed, recurrent effusion requiring intervention occurred in 21/148 (14%); median time to recurrence 3.8 months. Competing risks at 1 year: death without removal 35.7%, removal for decreased drainage 51.9%, removal for complications/other 7.3%."
