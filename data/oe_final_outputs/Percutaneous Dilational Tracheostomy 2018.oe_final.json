      "methods": "Narrative review; the article summarizes prospective and retrospective studies, randomized trials, and meta-analyses relevant to PDT indications, timing, techniques, and outcomes. No original patient enrollment or primary data collection was performed in this review.",
      "results": "Key points: No mortality benefit for early vs late tracheostomy in large RCTs; early placement associated with reduced sedation use but more procedures performed. Two prospective trials compared real-time ultrasound guidance with bronchoscopy for PDT: a small RCT (n=23) found higher rate of initial midline puncture with ultrasound; a larger RCT (n=177) reported longer procedural time and higher desaturation with bronchoscopy, with similar success and complication rates overall. Data on ultrasound remain limited."
