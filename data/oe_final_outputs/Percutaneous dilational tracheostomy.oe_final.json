      "abstract": "Percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT) is widely used in the ICU for airway management in patients with chronic respiratory failure or prolonged mechanical ventilation. Multiple techniques exist, with the single-dilator Ciaglia variant most commonly used. Flexible bronchoscopy is frequently employed as an adjunct and is associated with reduced complications compared with landmark-only techniques. Reported overall complication rates vary, with most being minor, and procedure-related mortality is low. PDT generally compares favorably with surgical tracheostomy with respect to procedure time, complications, and cost.",
      "methods": "Narrative review describing PDT techniques, adjuncts (bronchoscopy, ultrasonography, laryngeal mask airway), procedure-related complications, and comparative data from published studies including randomized comparisons of different PDT techniques.",
      "results": "Across studies summarized, bronchoscopy guidance during PDT was associated with a lower composite complication rate compared with non-bronchoscopic approaches in pooled nonrandomized data (16.8% vs 8.7%). Individual randomized comparisons among PDT techniques reported differences in specific complications (e.g., tracheal ring fracture, bleeding, hypoxemia), but head-to-head data are limited and findings are not uniform. Reported procedure-related mortality ranges from 0% to 0.7%, and bleeding from 0.4% to 8%, mostly minor."
