      "abstract": "Percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) is an effective and safe method for nutritional support in patients with malnutrition and impossibility of oral intake with an estimated survival higher than the months that require enteral nutrition beyond four weeks. The main indications include neoplasms of the upper air-digestive tract and neurological diseases, with dementia currently considered a controversial indication. Anatomical alterations and infectious diseases are the most frequent contraindications. There are different endoscopic techniques; the most widely used being the “pull” method, with a low mortality. Complications are more frequent in patients with multiple pathologies and the elderly. Wound infection, extraction of the tube, tube blockage and bronchoaspiratory pneumonia are the most prevalent complications. Adequate prior preparation of the patient and exhaustive maintenance of the tube can reduce the appearance of these.",
      "methods": "Narrative review summarizing indications, contraindications, procedural techniques (pull, push, introducer/gastropexy), periprocedural management (anticoagulant/antiplatelet handling, antibiotic prophylaxis), and post-insertion care for PEG.",
      "results": "PEG is favored over parenteral nutrition when the GI tract is functional and enteral nutrition is needed >4 weeks with life expectancy >2 months. Advanced dementia is generally not recommended as an indication. Absolute and relative contraindications are listed. The pull method is most used; gastropexy is preferred in selected cases (e.g., head-and-neck/oesophageal stenoses). Early feeding at 3-6 hours is safe. Complication rates overall range 13-43%, with major complications not exceeding 22%; most frequent are stoma infection, tube dislodgement/obstruction, and aspiration pneumonia. Antibiotic prophylaxis reduces stoma infection; careful antithrombotic management is required."
