      "abstract": "Objective: Percutaneous access to the stomach can be achieved by endoscopic or fluoroscopic methods. Our objective was to compare indications, complications, efficacy and outcomes of these two techniques. Methods: Records of 370 patients with feeding tubes placed either endoscopically by gastroenterology, or fluoroscopically by radiology, at our university-based tertiary care center over a 54-month period were reviewed. Results: 177 gastrostomies were placed endoscopically and 193 fluoroscopically. Nutrition was the most common indication in each group (94 and 92%), but the most common underlying diagnosis was neurologic impairment in the endoscopic group (n = 89, 50%) and malignancy in the fluoroscopic group (n = 134, 69%) (p < 0.001). Complications in the first 30 days were more common with fluoroscopic placement (23% versus 11%, p = 0.002), with infection most frequent. Correlates of late complications were inpatient status (OR 0.26, 95% CI: 0.13-0.51) and a diagnosis of malignancy (OR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.03-4.84). Average follow-up time was 108 days in the fluoroscopic group and 174 days in the endoscopic group. Conclusions: Both endoscopic and fluoroscopic gastrostomy tube placement are safe and effective. Outpatient status was associated with greater early and late complication rates; minor complications such as infection were greater in the fluoroscopic group, while malignancy was associated with late complications.",
      "methods": "Retrospective single-center study of consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous gastrostomy placement from February 1997 to August 2001. A total of 193 gastrostomy tubes were placed fluoroscopically (PRG) by radiology and 177 endoscopically (PEG) by gastroenterology. Data were abstracted from electronic and paper medical records and supplemented by telephone follow-up with patients, next-of-kin, and primary care providers. Complications were classified as early (≤30 days) or late (>30 days), and as major (requiring surgery or hospitalization, causing permanent sequelae, or death) or minor (requiring minor/no treatment without permanent sequelae). PRG technique used conscious sedation, T-fastener gastropexy, and no routine prophylactic antibiotics; PEG used the pull technique with prophylactic cefotetan 1 g IV. Statistical comparisons used chi-square tests and t-tests; multivariable logistic regression identified correlates of early and late complications.",
      "results": "Of 370 patients, 177 received PEG and 193 received PRG. Mean age was 68 ± 15 (PEG) versus 63 ± 14 (PRG). Male sex was 56.5% (PEG) and 59.1% (PRG). Indications were predominantly nutrition (PEG 94.4%, PRG 91.7%). Dysphagia was more common in PEG (67.8% vs 45.6%, p < 0.001); malignancy was more common in PRG (69.4% vs 23.2%, p < 0.001). Inpatient status was more frequent for PEG (91.0% vs 68.9%, p < 0.001). Early complications occurred in 19/177 (10.8%) PEG vs 44/193 (22.8%) PRG (p = 0.038), with early infections in 3/177 vs 14/193 (p = 0.012). Late complications occurred in 17/177 (10.1%) PEG vs 46/193 (23.8%) PRG (p = 0.002), with higher late tube dislodgement (2/177 vs 12/193, p = 0.012) and leakage (1/177 vs 10/193, p = 0.011) in PRG. Major complications: early 2 PEG vs 3 PRG; late 0 PEG vs 1 PRG. No procedure-attributable deaths; mortality reported as 8/177 (4.5%) vs 6/193 (3.1%) within 7 days in table. Logistic regression found outpatient status associated with higher early and late complications, and malignancy associated with late complications (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.03-4.84). Follow-up averaged 174 days (PEG) and 108 days (PRG)."
