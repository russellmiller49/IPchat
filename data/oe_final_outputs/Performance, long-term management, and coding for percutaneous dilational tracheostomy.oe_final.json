      "abstract": "Percutaneous dilatational tracheotomy (PDT) has become widely accepted and can be safely performed by surgeons and nonsurgeons at the ICU bedside. Bedside PDT offers proven clinical outcomes and resource savings, often serving as the tracheostomy procedure of choice for prolonged mechanical ventilation. This article outlines logistics and operations for incorporating PDT into routine ICU care, including team composition, patient selection, procedural steps, bronchoscopy/ultrasound guidance, training and credentialing, documentation, coding, and quality improvement. Evidence comparing PDT to open surgical tracheotomy suggests lower bleeding and mortality with PDT and no significant difference in overall complications, with a trend favoring PDT. Contraindications and special considerations are detailed, particularly for high-risk patients and less experienced operators.",
      "methods": "Topics in Practice Management narrative review and pragmatic guidance. The authors summarize existing evidence including systematic reviews and meta-analyses comparing percutaneous tracheostomy techniques to open surgical tracheotomy, and provide institutional practices for team setup, patient selection, procedural conduct (often with bronchoscopic guidance), postprocedural care, training thresholds, and coding/billing. No new randomized or observational cohort data were generated.",
      "results": "Synthesis of prior evidence indicates PDT is associated with lower bleeding and mortality versus open tracheotomy in a systematic review of 17 randomized controlled trials (1,212 patients). A meta-analysis reported no significant difference in overall complications with a trend favoring percutaneous methods. The American College of Surgeons recommends bedside PDT as the procedure of choice even in high-risk patients. The article provides a practical checklist, outlines absolute and relative contraindications (e.g., age <8 years, gross neck distortion, uncorrectable coagulopathy, PEEP >20 cm H2O), describes team roles, emphasizes bronchoscopy or ultrasound guidance, and recommends training thresholds (≥20 supervised cases and ≥10 annually to maintain competency). Coding guidance includes CPT 31600 for planned tracheostomy (0-day global for Medicare) and related bronchoscopic procedure codes when medically necessary."
