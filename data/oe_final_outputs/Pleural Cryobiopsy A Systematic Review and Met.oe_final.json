      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pleural biopsy using either video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or medical pleuroscopy is the current diagnostic criterion standard for pleural pathology with a high, yet imperfect, diagnostic yield. Cryobiopsy may provide greater tissue, increase depth of sampled tissue, and/or reduce crush artifact. However, its impact on diagnostic yield remains uncertain, and there are potential concerns regarding its safety too. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the same. METHODS: We performed a systematic search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar for studies evaluating the performance of pleural cryobiopsy, assessing the quality of each study using the Quality Assessment, Data Abstraction and Synthesis-2 tool. Using inverse variance weighting, we performed a meta-analysis of diagnostic yield estimations. We also reviewed specimen characteristics and complications related to the procedure. RESULTS: Seven observational studies involving 586 pleural biopsies (311 cryobiopsies and 275 flexible forceps biopsies) were evaluated. All but one study used a semi-rigid thoracoscope. Meta-analysis generated a diagnostic yield of 96.5% for cryobiopsy and 93.1% for forceps biopsy with an inverse variance-weighted OR of 1.61 (95% CI, 0.71-3.66) and an I2 of 16%. No instances of moderate to severe bleeding were reported with cryobiopsy. A funnel plot illustrated no major publication bias. CONCLUSIONS: Based on analysis of relatively homogenous observational data, pleural cryobiopsy is safe but does not increase diagnostic yield over flexible forceps biopsy. Adequately powered multicenter randomized trials are needed for further investigation.",
      "methods": "We performed a comprehensive search of MEDLINE, Embase, and Google Scholar in March 2019 in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. We used “cryobiopsy” OR “cryoprobe” OR “cryotechnology” AND “pleura” OR “thoracoscopy” OR “pleuroscopy” OR “pleural biopsy” OR “pleural effusion” as search terms to identify relevant studies. We applied these search terms to titles and abstracts. The bibliographies of shortlisted articles were also reviewed to identify any additional relevant studies. Conference abstract books were searched for additional studies that may have been presented but not yet published as manuscripts. We reviewed full texts of all shortlisted studies to identify all studies that met our Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome, Study Type criteria: patients included adult humans undergoing pleural biopsy via medical pleuroscopy (MP) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), intervention included cryobiopsy of the pleura, control included forceps biopsy of the pleura, outcome included overall diagnostic yield, and study type included observational or experimental. Exclusion criteria: case reports or series with fewer than five subjects, nonstandardized procedures, studies with overlapping datasets, and review papers. Two authors used the Quality Assessment, Data Abstraction and Synthesis-2 (QUADAS-2) tool to assess the quality of included studies. Meta-analysis of the diagnostic yield estimations was performed using inverse variance weighting to aggregate proportions and calculate a pooled odds ratio. Heterogeneity was measured using the I2 index with a fixed-effects model planned for I2 < 40% otherwise random-effects. A funnel plot was generated to assess publication bias.",
      "results": "Seven observational studies representing 586 biopsies (311 cryobiopsies and 275 flexible forceps biopsies) were analyzed. Most studies used a semi-rigid thoracoscope; one used a rigid thoracoscope but only flexible forceps and cryoprobe data were included for consistency. In all but one study, both cryobiopsy and flexible forceps biopsy were performed in the same patient. Meta-analysis yielded a pooled diagnostic yield of 96.5% for cryobiopsy and 93.1% for flexible forceps biopsy, with an inverse variance-weighted odds ratio of 1.61 (95% CI, 0.71-3.66), I2 = 16%, and overall effect z = 1.15, P = .25. Studies consistently showed larger specimen sizes with cryobiopsy and, where assessed, fewer instances of crush artifact. None of the studies reported any instances of major bleeding with cryobiopsy. A funnel plot showed no obvious publication bias."
