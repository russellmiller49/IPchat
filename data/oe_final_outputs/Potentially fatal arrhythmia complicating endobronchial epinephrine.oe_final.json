Both patients had no identified cardiac risk factors, were resuscitated with cardioversion, and recovered. Authors question efficacy and safety of endobronchial epinephrine for biopsy-related bleeding and advise against administering epinephrine into the lung periphery via guide sheath.",

      "results": "Both patients received epinephrine 0.25 mg endobronchially. Ventricular fibrillation developed within seconds, requiring cardioversion (150 J and 250 J). Electrolytes and subsequent cardiac evaluations were normal. No deaths occurred. Authors note literature reports of serious cardiac events with low-dose epinephrine and the rarity of fatal bleeding after TBLB."
