      "abstract": "Objectives: Prospective randomized trial to assess effectiveness and safety of neoadjuvant photodynamic therapy (PDT) plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone, and the possibility for subsequent surgery in locally advanced NSCLC. Methods: Patients with stage IIIA/IIIB central NSCLC (main bronchus/distal trachea involvement) initially unresectable or functionally inoperable but potentially operable after neoadjuvant therapy were randomized to chemotherapy plus endobronchial PDT or chemotherapy alone, followed by surgery. PDT used chlorine E6 (Radachlorin) and 662 nm laser light before each of three chemotherapy cycles. Results: 42 patients were randomized (21 per arm). Groups were similar at baseline. No major PDT complications were observed. Partial response occurred in 19/21 (90%) with PDT and 16/21 (76%) without (p = 0.460 in abstract; radiologic partial response p = 0.158 in text). These patients underwent thoracotomy; unresectable tumor at thoracotomy occurred in 3 patients in the No-PDT arm. There were 14 pneumonectomies and 5 lobectomies in the PDT arm vs 10 pneumonectomies and 3 lobectomies in the No-PDT arm. R0 resection was higher with PDT (89%) vs No-PDT (54%) (p = 0.038). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant PDT with chemotherapy is effective, safe, and improves resectability and resection completeness in stage III central NSCLC.",
      "methods": "Design: Prospective randomized trial comparing preoperative endobronchial PDT plus chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone for downstaging stage IIIA/IIIB central NSCLC (7th TNM). Eligibility: ≥18 years; distal trachea and/or main bronchus involvement; initially unresectable or functionally inoperable but potentially operable after neoadjuvant therapy; histologic confirmation; staging with bronchoscopy and CT; mediastinoscopy if nodes >1.0 cm; selective PET-CT to exclude distant metastases; spirometry and DLCO. Treatment: Chemotherapy paclitaxel 200 mg/m2 IV over 3 h plus carboplatin AUC < 6 IV over 1 h every 21 days for 3 cycles (dose modifications per toxicity). PDT: Radachlorin (chlorine E6) 1 mg/kg IV over 30 min; 2 h later 662 nm endoluminal laser via flexible bronchoscope to 150 J/cm2; administered 24-48 h prior to each chemotherapy cycle. Response assessed 2 weeks after completion (RECIST for radiology; endoscopic CR/partial/no response definitions). Surgery offered 3-6 weeks after last cycle to patients with complete or partial response. Statistics: Fisher’s exact test; p < 0.05 significant.",
      "results": "42 patients randomized (PDT n = 21; No-PDT n = 21); baseline balanced for age, sex, ECOG, stage IIIA/IIIB, histology. Reasons for initial unresectability/inoperability included tracheal involvement (n = 19), functional intolerance to pneumonectomy (n = 10), T4 mediastinal invasion (n = 6), multiple N2 (n = 5), N3 (n = 2). FEV1 at baseline: 69 ± 17% predicted (PDT) vs 71 ± 19% (No-PDT). PDT sessions averaged 11.5 min (range 9-14). PDT complications: hemoptysis in 2/21 (10%), minor. Chemotherapy completed in 36/42 (86%); discontinuations in 6 (3 per group) due to toxicity (n = 5) or progression (n = 1). Partial radiographic response: 19/21 (90%) vs 16/21 (76%), p = 0.158; endoscopic CR: 7/21 (33%) vs 2/21 (10%), p = 0.054; fewer non-responders with PDT. In functionally inoperable patients (PDT 6; No-PDT 4), FEV1 modestly improved; 5/6 (PDT) and 3/4 (No-PDT) underwent lobectomy instead of pneumonectomy due to main bronchus tumor disappearance. Tracheal recanalization in those with initial tracheal involvement: 9/9 (100%) PDT vs 7/10 (70%) No-PDT, p = 0.124. Thoracotomy performed in 19 (PDT) and 16 (No-PDT); resections achieved in 19 and 13, respectively; exploratory thoracotomy 0 vs 3, p = 0.086. R0 resection among resections: 17/19 (89%) PDT vs 7/13 (54%) No-PDT, p = 0.038; all R1 margins involved bronchial stump; no R2. Post-surgery deaths: 1 per group (pneumonia in PDT; COPD exacerbation in No-PDT), both after pneumonectomy. One tracheobronchial anastomosis failure in PDT, treated conservatively."
