      "abstract": "Background: The optimal volume of pleural fluid to diagnose a malignant effusion is unknown. Our study was designed to demonstrate if a minimum pleural fluid volume (10 mL) is equivalent to a large volume thoracentesis to make a cytopathologic diagnosis of malignancy. Methods: A total of 121 thoracentesis samples were obtained from 102 patients with suspected or known malignant effusions. Pleural fluid was collected in three aliquots for cytologic examination (10 mL, 60 mL, ≥150 mL). The pathologist was blinded to patient identifiers and aliquot volume. Sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV) were calculated for each volume for the diagnosis of malignancy. Results: Pleural malignancy was diagnosed in 90 patient encounters (74.4%). For direct smear/cytospin, there was increased sensitivity and NPV for 60 mL (P = .0058 and P = .045, respectively) and for ≥150 mL (P < .001 and P = .009, respectively) compared with 10 mL. For combined direct smear/cytospin and cell block preparations, statistical significance for sensitivity and NPV existed only between the 10 mL and ≥150 mL specimens (P = .0099 and P = .033, respectively). No statistical difference existed for specificity or PPV for any aliquot volume. Conclusions: The sensitivity for diagnosis of pleural malignancy is dependent on the pleural fluid volume extracted during thoracentesis. Volumes of 10 mL do not perform as well as larger volumes. When both direct smear/cytospin and cell block preparations are used, we recommend ≥150 mL, whereas when only direct smear/cytospin is used, 60 mL is adequate for the diagnosis of a malignant pleural effusion.",
      "methods": "Single-center prospective diagnostic accuracy study at Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI (IRB #1452). Between September 1, 2001, and August 31, 2007, 102 patients (60 women, 42 men) undergoing diagnostic thoracentesis for suspected malignant pleural effusion (n=94) or known malignant effusion undergoing subsequent thoracentesis (n=8) were enrolled, yielding 121 pleural fluid samples. All patients had moderate to large effusions (≥ one-third hemithorax). After routine clinical studies, three aliquots were collected for cytology: 10 mL, 60 mL, and ≥150 mL, processed per institutional cytopathology protocol. Entire aliquots were centrifuged; direct smears were prepared from sediment or cytospins if clear. Cell blocks were prepared if clot or sufficient sediment was present. Papanicolaou stain was used for smears/cytospins and hematoxylin-eosin for cell blocks. A single attending cytopathologist, blinded to patient identifiers and aliquot volumes, reviewed all study slides. The reference standard was cytologic or histologic confirmation of malignant pleural effusion within 6 months of the initial thoracentesis or CT evidence of pleural thickening/nodularity in a patient with a pathologically confirmed underlying malignancy. Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations (GEE) accounted for within-sample correlation of the three volume levels; pairwise comparisons were prespecified at alpha 0.05 without multiplicity adjustment. Analyses were conducted for direct smear/cytospin alone and for combined direct smear/cytospin plus cell block. Three encounters with missing slides for all volumes were excluded from analyses.",
      "results": "Of 121 thoracentesis encounters, 90 (74.3%) had malignant pleural effusions by the reference standard. After excluding 3 encounters with missing slides, 118 encounters remained, with 87 (73.7%) malignant. For direct smear/cytospin-only analyses including encounters with results for all three volumes (n=107; 78 malignant), sensitivity increased with volume: 10 mL 48.7% (38/78), 60 mL 62.8% (49/78), ≥150 mL 69.2% (54/78). Pairwise sensitivity differences were significant for 10 vs 60 mL (P = .0058) and 10 vs ≥150 mL (P < .001); 60 vs ≥150 mL was not significant (P = .090). NPV also increased: 10 mL 41.2% (28/68), 60 mL 47.3% (26/55), ≥150 mL 51.0% (25/49), with significant differences for 10 vs 60 mL (P = .045) and 10 vs ≥150 mL (P = .009). Specificity and PPV did not differ significantly across volumes. For combined direct smear/cytospin plus cell block (n=71; 54 malignant), sensitivity was 75.9% (41/54) at 10 mL, 79.6% (43/54) at 60 mL, and 87.0% (47/54) at ≥150 mL; 10 vs ≥150 mL was significant (P = .0099). NPV was 55.2% (16/29), 59.3% (16/27), and 66.7% (17/21), respectively; 10 vs ≥150 mL was significant (P = .033). Specificity and PPV showed no significant differences. Cancer types among malignant effusions included lung adenocarcinoma (31/90), metastatic breast carcinoma (24/90), and others."
