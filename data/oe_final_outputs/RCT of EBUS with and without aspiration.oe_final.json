      "abstract": "Background: Endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS)-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is performed with a dedicated 22- or 21-gauge needle while suction is applied. Fine-needle sampling without suction (capillary sampling) has been studied for endoscopic ultrasound and for biopsies at various body sites and has resulted in similar diagnostic yield and fewer traumatic samples. However, the role of EBUS-guided transbronchial needle capillary sampling (EBUS-TBNCS) is still to be determined. Methods: Adults with suspicious hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes (LNs) were included in a single-blinded, prospective, randomized trial comparing EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS. The primary end point was the concordance rate between the two techniques in terms of adequacy and diagnosis of cytologic samples. The secondary end point was the concordance rate between the two techniques in terms of quality of samples. Results: A total of 115 patients and 192 LNs were studied. Concordance between EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS was high, with no significant difference in adequacy (88% vs 88%, respectively [P = .858]; concordance rate, 83.9% [95% CI, 77.9-88.8]); diagnosis (36% vs 34%, respectively [P = .289]; concordance rate, 95.8% [95% CI, 92-98.2]); diagnosis of malignancy (28% vs 26%, respectively [P = .125]; concordance rate, 97.9% [95% CI, 94.8-99.4]); or sample quality (concordance rate, 83.3% [95% CI, 73.3-88.3]). Concordance between EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS was high irrespective of LN size (≤ 1 cm vs > 1 cm). Conclusions: Regardless of LN size, no differences in adequacy, diagnosis, or quality were found between samples obtained using EBUS-TBNA and those obtained using EBUS-TBNCS. There is no evidence of any benefit derived from the practice of applying suction to EBUS-guided biopsies. Trial registry: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT00886847; URL: www.clinicaltrials.gov",
      "methods": "Subjects: Adults (>18 years) with an indication for EBUS-guided needle biopsy for suspected benign or malignant mediastinal/hilar lymph node disease. Design: Prospective randomized single-blind trial comparing EBUS-TBNA (with suction) vs EBUS-TBNCS (without suction). Cytologists were blinded to technique. Primary endpoint: concordance in adequacy and diagnosis between techniques. Secondary endpoint: concordance in quality (Mair’s score 0-10: poor 0-2; good 3-6; superior 7-10). Procedures: Real-time linear EBUS bronchoscope; 22-gauge needle. General anesthesia via laryngeal mask. Only first two LNs per patient included; LNs >0.5 cm short-axis on EBUS. At each LN, two passes without suction and two with suction (10-mL syringe), 20-30 needle thrusts per pass. Randomized pass order (1&3 vs 2&4) to control first-pass bias; separate needles to prevent cross-contamination. Two slides per pass: Romanowsky and Papanicolaou (Pap) staining. Only initial four passes analyzed; additional passes if needed not analyzed. Cytology reviewed by on-site cytotechnologist then by single blinded cytopathologist; final read used for analysis. Cytology categories: inadequate; normal lymphoid; granulomatous inflammation; necrosis; malignancy. Adequacy: adequate vs inadequate. Diagnostic: granulomatous inflammation or malignancy vs nondiagnostic (inadequate, normal lymphoid, necrosis). Statistics: Per-LN paired analyses; McNemar tests; concordance with 95% CIs; stratified by LN size (≤1 cm vs >1 cm) and stain (Romanowsky vs Pap). Two-sided alpha 0.05. STATA 11.2.",
      "results": "A total of 115 patients and 192 LNs were analyzed. Adequacy: 88% with both EBUS-TBNA and EBUS-TBNCS (P = .858); concordance 83.9% (95% CI, 77.9-88.8). Diagnostic yield (granulomatous inflammation or malignancy): 36% with TBNA vs 34% with TBNCS (P = .289); concordance 95.8% (95% CI, 92-98.2). Malignancy diagnosis: 28% vs 26% (P = .125); concordance 97.9% (95% CI, 94.8-99.4). Quality (Mair’s score): no poor samples; good 13% vs 12%; superior 87% vs 88% (P = .724); concordance 83.3% (95% CI, 73.3-88.3). Findings were consistent irrespective of LN size (≤1 cm vs >1 cm) and robust in sensitivity analyses by number of LNs per patient. Concordance was higher with Pap vs Romanowsky staining for adequacy (80.2% vs 73.4%; P = .028), diagnosis (95.2% vs 89.6%; P = .012), malignancy diagnosis (96.5% vs 92.2%; P = .007), and quality (81.8% vs 73.4%; P = .008)."
