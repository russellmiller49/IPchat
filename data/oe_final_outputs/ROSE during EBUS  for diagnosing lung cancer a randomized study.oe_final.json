      "abstract": "Background: Although rapid on-site cytologic evaluation (ROSE) is widely used during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA), its role remains unclear. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of ROSE during EBUS-TBNA in the diagnosis of lung cancer. Methods: One hundred and twenty patients highly suspected of having lung cancer who had hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy or a tumor adjacent to the central airway were enrolled in this study and randomized to undergo EBUS-TBNA with or without ROSE. Results: Twelve patients with visible endobronchial lesions were excluded in the analysis. Thus, a total of 108 patients (55 in the ROSE group, 53 in the non-ROSE group) were analyzed. Additional procedures including EBUS-TBNA for lesions other than the main target lesion and/or transbronchial biopsy in the same setting were performed in 11% of patients in the ROSE group and 57% in the non-ROSE group (p < 0.001). Mean puncture number was significantly lower in the ROSE group (2.2 vs. 3.1 punctures, p < 0.001), and mean bronchoscopy time was similar between both groups (22.3 vs. 22.1 min, p = 0.95). The sensitivity and accuracy for diagnosing lung cancer were 88 and 89% in the ROSE group, and 86 and 89% in the non-ROSE group, respectively. No complications were associated with the procedures. Conclusions: ROSE during EBUS-TBNA is associated with a significantly lower need for additional bronchoscopic procedures and puncture number.",
      "methods": "Prospective randomized study at a single center (Nagoya Medical Center). Eligible patients were highly suspected of lung cancer with hilar/mediastinal lymphadenopathy or a tumor ≥10 mm adjacent to the central airway on CT, accessible by EBUS-TBNA. Patients with prior pathological diagnosis of lung cancer or with bronchoscopically visible endobronchial lesions were excluded. Randomization to EBUS-TBNA with or without ROSE was done by minimization with stratification factors: lymph node location (subcarinal vs other), node size (≥20 mm vs <20 mm), and examiner experience (staff vs residents ≤5 years after MD). EBUS-TBNA was performed under local anesthesia with lidocaine and midazolam sedation using BF-UC260F-OL8 bronchoscope with 21- or 22-gauge needle under real-time EBUS guidance. In the ROSE arm, a cytotechnologist performed on-site evaluation using Diff-Quik; additional passes/procedures were decided based on ROSE. In the non-ROSE arm, smears were fixed for cytology. Protocol defined 3 punctures as standard; additional punctures or procedures (EBUS-TBNA of other lesions and/or transbronchial biopsy for peripheral lesions) were allowed at examiner discretion. Pathology interpreted by an experienced pathologist; 'suspicious' was considered negative. Final diagnosis established by pathology, microbiology, or ≥6 months clinical/radiologic follow-up for benign. Dichotomous variables analyzed by χ2 or Fisher exact test; continuous by Student’s t test; significance at p ≤ 0.05.",
      "results": "A total of 120 patients were randomized; 12 with visible endobronchial lesions were excluded, leaving 108 analyzed (ROSE n=55, non-ROSE n=53) with balanced baseline characteristics. Additional procedures in the same setting occurred in 6/55 (11%) ROSE vs 30/53 (57%) non-ROSE (p < 0.001). Mean punctures for the main target were 2.2±0.9 in ROSE vs 3.1±0.4 in non-ROSE (p < 0.001). Bronchoscopy time was similar: 22.3±15.9 vs 22.1±7.7 minutes (p = 0.95). Overall diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA was 47/55 (85%) ROSE vs 40/53 (75%) non-ROSE (p = 0.23). Diagnostic accuracy for lung cancer was 89% in both groups (p = 0.95). No bronchoscopy-related complications were observed in either group."
