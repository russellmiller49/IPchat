      "abstract": "Background. The utility of rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) during endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) for lymph node staging in lung cancer is still controversial. The aim of this study was to assess the role of ROSE during EBUS-TBNA and the interpretation of its results. Methods. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients with suspected or diagnosed lung cancer who underwent EBUS-TBNA for lymph node staging. The slides were air-dried and Diff-Quik staining was used for ROSE. Additional smears were prepared for Papanicolaou staining and any remaining sample was placed in 10% formalin for histologic evaluation. The results of ROSE were compared with the results of the final pathologic diagnosis. Results. EBUS-TBNA was performed in 438 patients on 965 lymph nodes. Eighty-four lymph nodes (8.7%) were determined insufficient for definitive diagnosis by final cytologic evaluation. However 45 of the 84 lymph nodes were able to be diagnosed by histologic examination. The non-diagnostic sampling rate was 4.0%. There were no false-positive results on ROSE; however 25 cases (5.7%) were falsely evaluated as negative on ROSE. The concordance rate for staging between ROSE and final pathologic diagnosis was 94.3%. The sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, and diagnostic accuracy rate of EBUS-TBNA for correct lymph node staging was 96.5%, 100%, 89.8%, and 98.2%, respectively. Conclusions. ROSE during EBUS-TBNA for material adequacy showed a low rate of non-diagnostic sampling. There was a high agreement between the on-site and final pathologic evaluation during EBUS-TBNA; however immediate diagnosis should be approached with caution.",
      "methods": "Retrospective chart review of 438 consecutive patients with suspected or diagnosed lung cancer who underwent EBUS-TBNA for lymph node staging at Chiba University (April 2005-March 2008). Chest and upper abdominal CT with contrast was performed; EBUS-TBNA targeted radiologically defined mediastinal and/or hilar lymph nodes with short-axis ≥5 mm. Procedures used a convex probe EBUS bronchoscope (BF-UC260F-OL8, Olympus) and a 22-gauge needle (NA-201SX-4022, Olympus) under conscious sedation and local anesthesia with lidocaine. Multiple passes were performed until ROSE indicated diagnostic material or adequate lymphoid content (≥40 lymphocytes per high-power field or clusters of anthracotic pigment-laden macrophages). Aspirates were smeared; air-dried slides were Diff-Quik stained for ROSE; ethanol-fixed smears underwent Papanicolaou staining; remaining material was formalin-fixed for histology (H&E). Final pathologic diagnosis was based on Papanicolaou cytology plus H&E histology. Diagnostic performance metrics were calculated by standard definitions.",
      "results": "EBUS-TBNA sampled 965 lymph nodes (707 mediastinal, 258 hilar) in 438 patients (331 men, 107 women; mean age 70 years, range 28-87). Median EBUS short-axis nodal size was 8.7 mm (range 2.1-42.7). Compared with final cytology, 84/965 (8.7%) nodes were cytologically insufficient; histology established diagnoses in 45/84, leaving 39/965 non-diagnostic overall (non-diagnostic sampling rate 4.0%). ROSE versus Papanicolaou cytology showed 22 discrepancies (concordance 95.0%). Four ROSE-positive/Papanicolaou-negative cases were confirmed malignant on histology. ROSE versus final Papanicolaou/H&E: no false positives; 25/438 false negatives (5.7%); sensitivity 88.6%, specificity 100%, negative predictive value 89.8%, concordance 94.3%. EBUS-TBNA nodal staging versus final diagnosis: true positives 219, false negatives 8, true negatives 211, false positives 0; sensitivity 96.5%, specificity 100%, negative predictive value 89.8%, diagnostic accuracy 97.9%-98.2% (as reported). No complications related to EBUS-TBNA were observed."
