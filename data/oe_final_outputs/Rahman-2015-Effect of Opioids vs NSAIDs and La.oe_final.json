      "abstract": "IMPORTANCE: NSAIDs are often avoided in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) pleurodesis due to concern for reduced efficacy; smaller chest tubes may be less painful but their pleurodesis efficacy is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of analgesia (NSAIDs vs opiates) and chest tube size (12F vs 24F) on pain and pleurodesis efficacy. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: Multicenter 2×2 factorial phase 3 randomized clinical trial at 16 hospitals (UK, US, Canada), 2007-2013, enrolling 320 adults needing pleurodesis for symptomatic MPE. INTERVENTIONS: Thoracoscopy patients (n=206) all received 24F tubes and were randomized to NSAIDs vs opiates; non-thoracoscopy patients (n=114) were randomized to NSAIDs vs opiates and to 12F vs 24F tubes. MAIN OUTCOMES: Mean pain (0-100 mm VAS) while chest tube in situ (superiority) and pleurodesis failure at 3 months (need for further ipsilateral pleural intervention; noninferiority margin 15%). RESULTS: Pain did not differ between opiates (n=150; mean 23.8 mm) and NSAIDs (n=144; mean 22.1 mm; adjusted difference -1.5 mm; 95% CI -5.0 to 2.0; P=0.40). NSAID group required more rescue analgesia (26.3% vs 38.1%; rate ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.4; P=0.003). Pleurodesis failure occurred in 30/150 (20%) with opiates and 33/144 (23%) with NSAIDs, meeting noninferiority (1-sided 95% CI lower bound -10%; P=0.004). Pain was lower with 12F vs 24F tubes (22.0 mm vs 26.8 mm; adjusted difference -6.0 mm; 95% CI -11.7 to -0.2; P=0.04). Pleurodesis failure was higher with 12F vs 24F (30% vs 24%); noninferiority not met (1-sided 95% CI lower bound -20%; P=0.14). CONCLUSIONS: NSAIDs provided similar pain control to opiates and were noninferior for pleurodesis efficacy at 3 months but required more rescue medication. Smaller tubes modestly reduced pain but did not meet noninferiority for pleurodesis efficacy.",
      "methods": "Multicenter 2×2 factorial RCT. Adults with symptomatic MPE requiring pleurodesis were randomized by centralized minimization (factors: histology, procedure type, center). Thoracoscopy was a clinical decision; thoracoscopy patients received 24F tubes and were randomized only to analgesia (NSAIDs vs opiates). Non-thoracoscopy patients were randomized to analgesia and to chest tube size (12F vs 24F). All received acetaminophen background analgesia. NSAID regimen: ibuprofen 800 mg orally three times daily (max 2.4 g/day). Opiate regimen: oral morphine 10 mg four times daily, titratable to 20 mg four times daily (max 80 mg/day). Rescue: IV morphine permitted. Pleurodesis: standardized talc (4 g) per protocol; intrapleural anesthetic for talc slurry as per UK guidelines. Primary outcomes: mean VAS pain while tube in situ (up to 5 days) and pleurodesis failure by 3 months (further ipsilateral pleural intervention). Pain VAS collected 4 times/day; additional VAS before rescue medication with carry-forward to next scheduled time. Outcome assessors were blinded to pain scores and pleurodesis failure classification with adjudication rules. Statistical analysis: Mixed-effects linear regression (pain) adjusted for minimization variables; generalized linear model with binomial family and identity link for absolute risk difference (pleurodesis failure). ITT for pain included randomized patients with ≥1 postrandomization VAS using multiple imputation; pleurodesis failure compared for noninferiority in ITT and per-protocol (preplanned). Competing risks accounted for deaths. Interaction between drain size and analgesia tested. Two-sided α=0.05 for superiority; one-sided 95% CI for noninferiority (margin 15%).",
      "results": "320 patients randomized (160 NSAIDs, 160 opiates); 206 underwent thoracoscopy (all 24F), 114 non-thoracoscopy randomized to 12F (n=57) or 24F (n=57) tubes. Pain outcome available in 308/320 (96%); pleurodesis outcomes available in 294/320 (ITT primary analysis). Analgesia comparison: Mean pain VAS similar between opiates (n=150; 23.8 mm) and NSAIDs (n=144; 22.1 mm); adjusted difference -1.5 mm (95% CI -5.0 to 2.0; P=0.40). Rescue analgesia use higher with NSAIDs (26.3% vs 38.1%; rate ratio 2.1; 95% CI 1.3-3.4; P=0.003). Pleurodesis failure by 3 months occurred in 30/150 (20%) opiates and 33/144 (23%) NSAIDs; noninferiority met (1-sided 95% CI lower bound -10%; P=0.004). Tube size comparison (non-thoracoscopy patients): Pain lower with 12F vs 24F (n=54 vs n=56; means 22.0 vs 26.8 mm); adjusted difference -6.0 mm (95% CI -11.7 to -0.2; P=0.04). Pleurodesis failure higher with 12F vs 24F (30% vs 24%); noninferiority not met (1-sided 95% CI lower bound -20%; P=0.14). Complications during chest tube insertion were more common with 12F vs 24F (24% vs 14%; OR 1.91; P=0.20)."
