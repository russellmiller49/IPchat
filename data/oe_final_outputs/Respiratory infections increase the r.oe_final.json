      "abstract": "Background: The most serious complications of airway stenting are long term, including infection and granulation tissue formation. However, no studies had quantified the incidence rate of long-term complications for different stents. Methods: Retrospective cohort of all patients at a single cancer center receiving airway stents for malignant airway obstruction (January 2005-August 2010). Patients with >1 stent type in place simultaneously were excluded. Complications recorded: lower respiratory tract infections, migration, granulation tissue, mucus plugging requiring intervention, tumor overgrowth, fracture. Results: 172 patients with 195 stent procedures were included (Ultraflex 118, Aero 31, Dumon silicone 46). Aero stents increased infection risk (HR 1.98; 95% CI 1.03-3.81; p=0.041). Dumon silicone tube stents increased migration risk (HR 3.52; 95% CI 1.41-8.82; p=0.007). Silicone stents (HR 3.32; 95% CI 1.59-6.93; p=0.001) and lower respiratory tract infections (HR 5.69; 95% CI 2.60-12.42; p<0.001) increased risk of granulation tissue. Lower respiratory tract infections were associated with decreased survival (HR 1.57; 95% CI 1.11-2.21; p=0.011). Conclusions: Stent type is associated with different risks of infection, migration, and granulation tissue; infections confer substantial morbidity and mortality and are strongly linked to granulation tissue formation.",
      "methods": "Design: Retrospective cohort at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Population: All patients undergoing airway stenting for malignant central airway obstruction from January 2005 to August 2010. Exclusions: concurrent use of >1 stent type. Data abstraction: standardized forms with predefined definitions in a codebook; radiologist blinded to clinical data reviewed CTs. Interventions: Expandable metal stents placed with flexible/rigid bronchoscopy; silicone stents placed with rigid bronchoscopy; no perioperative or prophylactic antibiotics/steroids. Outcomes: Primary—time to lower respiratory tract infection (clinical diagnosis requiring antibiotics; pneumonia vs acute bronchitis classification per imaging). Secondary—time to migration, granulation tissue, mucus plugging requiring bronchoscopic cleaning, tumor overgrowth, stent fracture (all bronchoscopically confirmed except infections). Statistical analysis: Time-to-event measured from implantation to event; censoring at last follow-up. Univariate Cox models; time-varying covariates (e.g., infection) coded 0 until event then 1. Variables with p<0.10 entered multivariable extended Cox models with backward elimination (retain p<0.05). Kaplan-Meier plots. Two-sided p<0.05 significant. Software: SAS 9.1 and S-Plus 7.0.",
      "results": "Stents: Ultraflex 118/195 (60%), Aero 31/195 (16%), Dumon silicone 46/195 (24%; 28 Y, 18 tube). Events among 195 procedures: lower respiratory tract infection in 73 (106 total infection episodes); granulation tissue 38; mucus impaction 48; hemoptysis 17; migration 27 (among 167 procedures after excluding 28 Y stents); fracture 4; new fistula 2; tumor overgrowth 25. Infections: median time 1 month (0-35); 45% outpatient, 34% admitted to floor, 21% ICU; 13% required mechanical ventilation; 11% required stent removal; 23% died within 14 days of infection. Multivariable: Aero vs Ultraflex increased infection risk (HR 1.98; 95% CI 1.03-3.81; p=0.041). Migration: silicone tube stents vs Ultraflex HR 3.52 (95% CI 1.41-8.82; p=0.007). Granulation: silicone stents HR 3.32 (95% CI 1.59-6.93; p=0.001) and time-varying infection HR 5.69 (95% CI 2.60-12.42; p<0.001). Mucus impaction: left-sided location increased risk; older age and post-stent chemotherapy decreased risk. Survival (172 patients; median follow-up 3 months): lower respiratory tract infection increased mortality HR 1.57 (95% CI 1.11-2.21; p=0.011); silicone and tracheal stents associated with lower mortality; pre-stent radiation associated with higher mortality."
