      "abstract": "Background: Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is considered a useful and minimally invasive modality for treating centrally located early lung cancer. To date, there has been limited information on the long-term outcome of patients treated with PDT, especially those who are medically operable. Methods: Beginning in 1994, patients with roentgenographically occult bronchogenic squamous cell carcinoma (ROSCC) who met our criteria underwent PDT at Tohoku University Hospital and were followed up through 2006. Our criteria were as follows: (1) ROSCC without distant metastasis; (2) medically operable by means of lobectomy or further resection; (3) longitudinal tumor length of < 10 mm; and (4) superficial bronchoscopic tumor findings. Results: A total of 48 patients with ROSCC underwent PDT. The complete response (CR) rate was 94% (45 of 48 of patients). Nine patients (20%) had local recurrence after CR. A total of 11 deaths was observed, with 6 resulting from multiple primary lung cancer and only 1 from the original ROSCC. The 5-year and 10-year overall survival rates for all 48 patients were 81% and 71%, respectively. The Cox proportional hazard model showed that only metachronous multiple primary lung cancer was an independent poor prognostic factor. Conclusions: PDT is thought to be a first-line modality for patients who have ROSCC with a tumor length of < 10 mm, even if the tumor is medically operable. Most local recurrence can be cured by active therapy such as surgery, radiotherapy, or PDT. Multiple primary lung cancer subsequent to PDT is an important issue from the viewpoint of survival.",
      "methods": "PDT has been performed at Tohoku University Hospital since 1994. Workup included bronchoscopy, chest CT, upper abdominal CT/ultrasonography, brain CT/MRI, and bone scintigraphy. Eligibility: (1) no metastatic lesions; (2) longitudinal extent of ROSCC ≤ 10 mm; (3) distal edge visible by bronchoscopy; (4) bronchoscopic findings categorized as minute or hidden; (5) medically operable (lobectomy or more); and (6) informed consent. Bronchoscopic classification (remarkable, minute, hidden) per prior work; since 1997, autofluorescence bronchoscopy and endobronchial ultrasonography used. PDT protocol: porfimer sodium 2 mg/kg IV 48 h pre-irradiation; excimer dye laser via bronchoscope delivering 100 J/cm2 over 10-20 min. Bronchial toileting at day 7. Surveillance with bronchoscopy/biopsy/cytology at 1, 2, 3 months; then bronchoscopy, sputum cytology, chest CT every 3 months in year 1, every 6 months in years 2-5, then annually. CR defined as absence of tumor by biopsy or brushing cytology for ≥ 4 weeks. Local recurrence defined at the same lesion after CR. Multiple primary lung cancer per Martini and Melamed criteria. Survival endpoints (OS, RFS, DFS) by Kaplan-Meier; log-rank tests for subgroup comparisons. Cox proportional hazards model used for multivariable analysis; p ≤ 0.05 considered significant.",
      "results": "Forty-eight medically operable men (mean age 70 years) with ROSCC underwent PDT (1994-2006). CR achieved in 45/48 (94%). There was no significant relationship between tumor response and tumor location (p = 0.64, Mann-Whitney U). Local recurrence after CR occurred in 9/45 (20%), with no significant association with location (p = 0.29, Mann-Whitney U); relapse-free interval 3-47 months (mean 25). Treatments for recurrence included radiotherapy (n=5), surgery (n=2), additional PDT (n=1), chemotherapy (n=1); 8/9 alive at last follow-up. Metachronous multiple primary lung cancer occurred in 10 patients (range 12-89 months after PDT; mean 45), with 5 deaths from metachronous cancers. Median follow-up for all 48 patients was 63 months (living patients, 70 months); 2 lost to follow-up (21 and 27 months). Deaths (n=11): original ROSCC (n=1), metachronous multiple lung cancer (n=5), synchronous multiple lung cancer (n=1), myocardial infarction (n=2), cerebral hemorrhage (n=1), unknown (n=1; counted as original lung cancer death in survival analysis). Five- and 10-year OS were 81% and 71%. OS did not differ by local recurrence (5-year OS 100% vs 76%; log-rank p = 0.62). Patients with metachronous multiple primary lung cancer had worse OS (5-year OS 56% vs 88%; log-rank p = 0.031). Five- and 10-year RFS were 60% and 54%; DFS 56% and 43%. In multivariable Cox analysis, metachronous multiple primary lung cancer was an independent poor prognostic factor (hazard ratio 1.99; 95% CI 1.01-4.03); tumor location, local recurrence, and tumor response were not significant."
