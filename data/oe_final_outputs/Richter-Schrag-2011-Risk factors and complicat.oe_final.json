      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Most studies exclude patients with severe coagulation disorders or those taking anticoagulants when evaluating the outcomes of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG).\nOBJECTIVE: To investigate complications and risk factors of PEG in a large clinical series including patients undergoing antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy.\nMETHODS: During a six-year period, 1057 patients referred for PEG placement were prospectively audited for clinical outcome. Exclusion criteria and follow-up care were defined. Complications were defined as minor or severe. Uni- and multivariate analyses were used to evaluate 14 risk factors. No standardized antibiotic prophylaxis was given.\nRESULTS: A total of 1041 patients (66% male, 34% female) with the following conditions underwent PEG: neurogenic dysphagia (n=450), cancer (n=385) and others (n=206). No anticoagulants were administered to 351 patients, thrombosis prophylaxis was given to 348 while full therapeutic anticoagulation was received by 313. No increased bleeding risk was associated with patients who had above-normal international normalized ratio values (OR 0.79 [95% CI 0.08 to 7.64]; P=1.00). The total infection rate was 20.5% in patients with malignant disease, and 5.5% in those with nonmalignant disease. Severe complications occurred in 19 patients (bleeding 0.5%, peritonitis 1.3%). Cirrhosis (OR 2.91 [95% CI 1.31 to 6.54]; P=0.008), cancer (OR 2.34 [95% CI 1.33 to 4.12]; P=0.003) and radiation therapy (OR 2.34 [95% CI 1.35 to 4.05]; P=0.002) were significant predictors of post-PEG infection. The 30-day mortality rate was 5.8%. There were no procedure-related deaths.\nCONCLUSIONS: Cancer, cirrhosis and radiation therapy were predictors of infection. Post-PEG bleeding and other complications were rare events. Collectively, the data suggested that patients taking concurrent anticoagulants had no elevated risk of post-PEG bleeding.",
      "methods": "A total of 1057 patients who underwent PEG placement according to a modified pull-through technique during a six-year period were prospectively audited. Exclusion criteria: inability to perform standard pull-through technique (with or without Savary-Gilliard dilation) due to stenosis; need for additional imaging (CT) to perform PEG; premature termination due to respiratory/other complications; missing written consent. No standardized antibiotic prophylaxis was used. Antiplatelet agents (acetylsalicylic acid or clopidogrel) and unfractionated heparin were generally not discontinued. Phenprocoumon was not defined as a contraindication. Ascites were drained during the seven-day PEG healing time. Observation included in-hospital period or at least eight days; thereafter, annual follow-up. Complications within hospitalization were classified as minor (peristomal wound infection; gastroparesis ≥500 mL persistent reflux) or severe (postprocedural bleeding; peritonitis). Bleeding defined by hematemesis or passage of blood anally, via stoma, or PEG tube. Follow-up complications after discharge included buried bumper and blocked/leaking tubes. Logistic regression (univariate and multivariate) evaluated 14 risk factors. Two-sided tests, alpha 0.05; SPSS 15.0.",
      "results": "Of 1057 patients, 15 (1.51%) were excluded, leaving 1041 included (66% male). Indications: neurogenic dysphagia 450, malignant disease 385, others 206. Anticoagulation status: none 351; thrombosis prophylaxis with LMWH 348; full anticoagulation 313 (UFH/LMWH/phenprocoumon ± antiplatelets); antiplatelet monotherapy 29. At PEG, 480 patients received antibiotics. Neurological patients had higher pre-PEG aspiration pneumonia risk (OR 9.9, 95% CI 7.4-13.2; P<0.001). Minor complications: local infection 115 (11.1%), gastroparesis 7 (0.7%). Severe complications: bleeding 5 (0.5%), peritonitis 14 (1.3%). Infection rate: malignant disease 20.5% (79/385), nonmalignant disease 5.5% (36/656). Multivariate predictors of infection: cirrhosis (OR 2.91, 95% CI 1.31-6.54; P=0.008), cancer (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.33-4.12; P=0.003), radiation therapy (OR 2.34, 95% CI 1.35-4.05; P=0.002). No increased bleeding risk with above-normal INR (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.08-7.64; P=1.00). Follow-up complications after discharge: buried bumper 21, leakage or blockage 33. Thirty-day mortality was 5.8% with no procedure-related deaths."
