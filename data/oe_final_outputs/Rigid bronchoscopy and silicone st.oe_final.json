      "abstract": "The field of interventional pulmonology has grown significantly over the past several decades now including the diagnosis and therapeutic treatment of complex airway disease. Rigid bronchoscopy is an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and management of several malignant and non-malignant causes of central airway obstruction (CAO) and has become integral after the inception of airway stenting. The management of CAO can be a complicated endeavor with significant risks making the understanding of basic rigid bronchoscopy techniques, ablative technologies, anesthetic care and stenting of utmost importance in the care of these complex patients. This review article will focus on the history of rigid bronchoscopy, the technical aspects of performing a rigid bronchoscopy as well as the use of silicone stents their indications, complications and placement techniques.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of rigid bronchoscopy and silicone stenting for central airway obstruction. The article describes historical context, equipment, technical aspects of rigid intubation, anesthetic considerations, ventilation techniques, and stenting indications/complications. No systematic search strategy, inclusion/exclusion criteria, or formal evidence synthesis methods are reported.",
      "results": "The review summarizes epidemiology and etiologies of malignant and non-malignant CAO, classification of obstruction types, and the role of rigid bronchoscopy. It cites a multicenter registry of 947 patients at 23 centers undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for CAO with an average technical success rate of 93% (defined as opening of >50% of the airway). In subsets with patient-reported outcomes, dyspnea improved in 48% of 187 patients and quality of life improved in 42% of 183 patients; greater baseline dyspnea and endobronchial obstruction were associated with greater improvements, whereas higher ASA class, renal failure, lobar obstruction, and tracheoesophageal fistula were associated with less improvement. A prospective case series of 53 patients (predominantly malignant 45% and post-transplant stenosis 43%) reported subjective improvements in dyspnea and QOL (UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire and SF-36) and statistically significant improvements in FEV1 and FVC. No survival benefit data are reported for relief of malignant CAO."
