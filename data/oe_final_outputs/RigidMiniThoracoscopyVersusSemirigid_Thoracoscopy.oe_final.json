      "abstract": "Background: There is debate regarding the ideal instrument for medical thoracoscopy. The authors compared rigid mini-thoracoscopy with semirigid thoracoscopy for thoracoscopic pleural biopsy. Methods: Consecutive subjects with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion were randomized (1:1 ratio) to mini-thoracoscopy or semirigid thoracoscopy groups. The primary objective was a comparison of the diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy. Key secondary outcomes were the comparison of sedative/analgesic dose, operator-rated and patient-rated pain on visual analog scale (VAS), operator-rated overall procedural satisfaction (VAS), pleural biopsy size, and complications between the groups. Results: Of the 88 screened subjects, 73 were randomized: 36 to mini-thoracoscopy and 37 to semirigid thoracoscopy. Diagnostic yield of pleural biopsy in the mini-thoracoscopy (69.4%) and semirigid thoracoscopy groups (81.1%) was similar on intention-to-treat analysis (P = 0.25). Although the operator-rated overall procedure satisfaction scores were similar between groups (P = 0.87), operator-rated pain [VAS (mean ± SD), 43.5 ± 16.7 vs. 31.7 ± 15.8; P < 0.001] and patient-rated pain (VAS, 41.9 ± 17.3 vs. 32.1 ± 16.5; P = 0.02) scores were greater in the mini-thoracoscopy group. Mean dose of fentanyl and midazolam received was similar between the 2 groups (P = 0.28 and 0.68, respectively). Biopsy size was larger in the mini-thoracoscopy group (16.1 ± 4.5 vs. 8.3 ± 2.9 mm; P < 0.001). Three minor complications occurred in the mini-thoracoscopy group and 6 in the semirigid thoracoscopy group (P = 0.11). There were no serious adverse events or procedure-related mortality. Conclusion: Diagnostic yield of rigid mini-thoracoscopy is not superior to semirigid thoracoscopy. Use of semirigid thoracoscope may provide greater patient comfort.",
      "methods": "Investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized controlled trial at a single center (AIIMS, New Delhi) enrolling between July 2016 and June 2018. Adults with undiagnosed exudative pleural effusion, after non-diagnostic thoracentesis including cytology, were randomized 1:1 to rigid mini-thoracoscopy (Richard Wolf; 5.5-mm scope, 3.5-mm working channel; 3.5-mm rigid biopsy forceps) or semirigid thoracoscopy (Olympus LTF-160; 7.0-mm outer diameter, 2.8-mm working channel; flexible forceps) under moderate conscious sedation (midazolam and fentanyl). Entry trocars: 5.5-mm metallic for mini-thoracoscopy, 10-mm plastic for semirigid. Minimum biopsies: ≥4 (mini-thoracoscopy) and 6-8 (semirigid). Switching to the alternative instrument was allowed if difficulty obtaining biopsy occurred. Histopathology, mycobacterial cultures, and Xpert MTB/Rif were performed on all biopsies. Chest drain placed post-procedure. Follow-up to 6 months if biopsy was non-diagnostic.",
      "results": "Seventy-three subjects were randomized (36 mini-thoracoscopy; 37 semirigid). Two crossed over from mini to semirigid for adhesions/maneuverability; in 2 subjects (one per group) the procedure was abandoned for limited pleural access. Baseline characteristics were similar. On thoracoscopic visualization, abnormal findings were present in 65/73 (89.0%). Intention-to-treat diagnostic yield was 69.4% for mini-thoracoscopy and 81.1% for semirigid (P = 0.25). As-treated diagnostic yield was 75.6% (mini) and 84.2% (semirigid) (P = 0.30). Adequate biopsies were obtained in all subjects in both groups. Overall, definitive histopathologic diagnosis (malignancy or TB) was achieved in 48/71 (67.6%): malignancy 37 (52.1%), TB 11 (18.2%), nonspecific pleuritis 21 (29.6%), and normal pleura 2 (2.8%). Biopsy size was larger with mini-thoracoscopy (16.1 ± 4.5 mm) than semirigid (8.3 ± 2.9 mm) (P < 0.001). Operator-rated pain (VAS) 43.5 ± 16.7 vs 31.7 ± 15.8 (P < 0.001) and patient-rated pain 41.9 ± 17.3 vs 32.1 ± 16.5 (P = 0.02) were higher with mini-thoracoscopy; overall procedural satisfaction similar (P = 0.87). Maneuverability favored semirigid (P = 0.003). Sedation doses (midazolam, fentanyl) were similar (P = 0.68 and 0.28). Minor complications occurred in 3 (mini) vs 6 (semirigid) (P = 0.11). No serious adverse events or procedure-related mortality."
