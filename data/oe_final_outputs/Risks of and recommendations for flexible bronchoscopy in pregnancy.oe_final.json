      "abstract": "This narrative review summarizes physiologic and anatomic respiratory changes during pregnancy relevant to flexible bronchoscopy, outlines procedure- and sedation-related risks for mother and fetus, reviews safety considerations for commonly used bronchoscopy medications with FDA pregnancy risk categories, and provides practical recommendations for maternal and fetal monitoring (including pulse oximetry and optional capnography), patient positioning to avoid supine hypotensive syndrome, and indications for emergent versus nonemergent procedures. Evidence directly addressing flexible bronchoscopy in pregnancy is limited to case reports and one prior review; broader endoscopy literature suggests no clear increase in adverse events among pregnant women undergoing upper endoscopy in a case-control study, though power was insufficient to exclude small fetal risks.",
      "methods": "Narrative literature review drawing on published case reports, a prior review, and indirect evidence from upper and lower gastrointestinal endoscopy during pregnancy, as well as physiologic, anesthetic, and monitoring literature. No systematic search strategy, inclusion criteria, or quantitative synthesis were reported.",
      "results": "The review identifies pregnancy-related respiratory adaptations (decreased functional residual capacity, increased minute ventilation, increased oxygen consumption) and upper airway mucosal changes that can impact bronchoscopy. It emphasizes maternal hypoxemia and hypotension as key fetal risks, highlights medication considerations by FDA pregnancy risk category, recommends continuous pulse oximetry with supplemental oxygen to maintain saturation at 97 to 100, considers capnography to detect hypercapnia, advises left lateral tilt positioning after 20 weeks to avoid supine hypotensive syndrome, and notes that emergent, lifesaving bronchoscopy should proceed with maternal safety prioritized while minimizing fetal risk. No pooled quantitative outcomes are provided for pregnant patients undergoing flexible bronchoscopy."
