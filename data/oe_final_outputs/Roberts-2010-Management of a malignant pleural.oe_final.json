      "methods": "Guideline development synthesizing evidence on diagnosis and management of malignant pleural effusion (MPE). Recommendations address observation, therapeutic pleural aspiration, intercostal tube drainage with chemical pleurodesis, thoracoscopy with talc poudrage, and indwelling pleural catheters. Technique guidance for talc slurry pleurodesis includes small-bore (10-14 F) tube insertion, controlled drainage, confirmation of lung re-expansion, intrapleural lidocaine (3 mg/kg; max 250 mg) prior to sclerosant, instillation of 4-5 g sterile graded talc in saline, short clamp period, and tube removal within 24-48 h.",
      "results": "Key statements: Most MPEs are symptomatic; massive effusions are commonly malignant. Therapeutic aspiration alone has high 1â€‘month recurrence and is not recommended if life expectancy >1 month. Small-bore chest tubes followed by pleurodesis are preferred to repeated aspiration except in very short prognosis. Talc is the most effective sclerosant; graded talc reduces hypoxemia risk; slurry and poudrage are similarly effective. Incomplete pleural apposition reduces pleurodesis success; indwelling pleural catheters are preferred for trapped lung. Pain and fever are the most common post-sclerosant adverse effects; reported pain ranges from 7% with talc to 60% with older agents like doxycycline. Randomized data indicate small- vs large-bore tubes have equivalent efficacy; early pleurodesis once radiographic re-expansion is achieved shortens hospital stay with similar success (~80%)."
