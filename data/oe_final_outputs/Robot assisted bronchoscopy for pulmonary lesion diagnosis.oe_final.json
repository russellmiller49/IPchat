      "abstract": "Background: The Robotic Endoscopic System (Auris Health, Inc., Redwood City, CA) has the potential to overcome several limitations of contemporary guided-bronchoscopic technologies for the diagnosis of lung lesions. Our objective is to report on the initial post-marketing feasibility, safety and diagnostic yield of this technology. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed data on consecutive cases in which robot-assisted bronchoscopy was used to sample lung lesions at four centers in the US (academic and community) from June 15th, 2018 to December 15th, 2018. Results: One hundred and sixty-seven lesions in 165 patients were included in the analysis, with an average follow-up of 185 ± 55 days. The average size of target lesions was 25.0 ± 15.0 mm. Seventy-one percent were located in the peripheral third of the lung. Pneumothorax and airway bleeding occurred in 3.6 and 2.4% cases, respectively. Navigation was successful in 88.6% of cases. Tissue samples were successfully obtained in 98.8%. The diagnostic yield estimates ranged from 69.1 to 77% assuming the cases of biopsy-proven inflammation without any follow-up information (N = 13) were non-diagnostic and diagnostic, respectively. The yield was 81.5, 71.7 and 26.9% for concentric, eccentric and absent r-EBUS views, respectively. Diagnostic yield was not affected by lesion size, density, lobar location or centrality. Conclusions: RAB implementation in community and academic centers is safe and feasible, with an initial diagnostic yield of 69.1-77% in patients with lung lesions that require diagnostic bronchoscopy. Comparative trials with the existing bronchoscopic technologies are needed to determine cost-effectiveness of this technology.",
      "methods": "We retrospectively reviewed consecutive cases using robot-assisted bronchoscopy (RAB) with the Monarch Endoscopy Platform (Auris Health, Inc.) for diagnosis of lung lesions at four US centers from June 15, 2018 to December 15, 2018. Inclusion: adults ≥18 years, acceptable for elective bronchoscopy under general anesthesia, with pulmonary lesions requiring bronchoscopic biopsy (suspected primary lung cancer per guidelines, suspected recurrence/progression, lesions in patients with history of extrathoracic malignancy, or suspected mycobacterial/fungal infection requiring tissue diagnosis). Exclusion: obvious endobronchial lesion easily biopsied by conventional bronchoscopy. Endpoints: device/procedure-related complications (pneumothorax of any size, significant airway bleeding requiring management with conventional bronchoscope, respiratory failure within 24 h), successful navigation (eccentric or concentric r-EBUS view or diagnostic tissue), and diagnostic yield (final pathology diagnostic without subsequent discordant diagnosis/progression; cases treated for cancer without pathologic diagnosis considered non-diagnostic). General anesthesia with endotracheal tube; standard inspection bronchoscopy performed; EBUS-TBNA when indicated prior to RAB. The robotic bronchoscope comprises an outer sheath (6.0 mm) and inner scope (4.2 mm), with EM field generator; r-EBUS used for confirmation; no CBCT. Biopsy tools advanced through 2.1 mm working channel under fluoroscopy. Statistical analysis: chi-squared tests for associations; multivariable logistic regression adjusting for lesion location, centrality, density, size, bronchus sign, and r-EBUS view; two-tailed p<0.05 significant; Stata 14.1.",
      "results": "A total of 167 lesions in 165 patients were biopsied; average follow-up 185 ± 55 days. Mean lesion size 25.0 ± 15.0 mm; 70.7% peripheral; bronchus sign present in 106/167 (63.5%); 125/167 (74.9%) solid. Navigation successful in 148/167 (88.6%). r-EBUS detected target in 141/167 (84.4%): concentric 81/141 (57.5%), eccentric 60/141 (42.5%). Tissue samples obtained in 161/165 (97.6%) patients; 4 (2.4%) cases without samples (1 software failure, 3 unsuccessful navigation). Overall diagnostic yield ranged 69.1-77%, depending on handling of 13 inflammation-only cases without follow-up. Diagnostic yield by r-EBUS view: concentric 66/81 (81.5%), eccentric 43/60 (71.7%), no view 7/26 (26.9%); p<0.001. Yield higher with bronchus sign 83/106 (78.3%) vs 54.1% without; p=0.001. Yield not different by lesion density (solid 86/125 [68.8%] vs ground glass 12/17 [70.6%]; p=0.74), central vs peripheral (73.5% vs 67.8%; p=0.47), or size (<10 mm 5/11 [45.5%], 10-30 mm 74/108 [68.5%], >30 mm 37/48 [77.1%]; p=0.11). Multivariable logistic regression: bronchus sign OR 2.3 (95% CI 1.0-5.3; p=0.04); r-EBUS view vs no view: eccentric OR 7.4 (95% CI 2.4-22.9; p<0.001), concentric OR 10.0 (95% CI 3.2-31.1; p<0.001). Complications: pneumothorax 6/167 (3.6%), chest tube in 4/167 (2.4%); significant airway bleeding 4/167 (2.4%), controlled with cold saline; no respiratory failure or deaths."
