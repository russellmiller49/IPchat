      "abstract": "Bronchoscopic interventions are preferred for sampling suspicious pulmonary lesions as they have lower complications and can achieve diagnosis and staging in one single procedure. Limitations in existing guided bronchoscopy platforms has led to developments in robotic assisted technologies. These devices may allow the bronchoscopist to more precisely maneuver the scope and instruments into the periphery of the lungs under direct visualization while also ensuring stability during sampling of the target lesions. These devices have the potential to improve the diagnostic yield in sampling peripheral lung lesions and may play a role in the treatment of non-operable or oligometastatic peripheral tumors using bronchoscopic ablative therapies. In this article, we review the existing robotic bronchoscopy technologies and summarize the available pre-clinical and clinical data supporting their use.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of pre-clinical (cadaver) and clinical feasibility/post-marketing studies of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy platforms (Monarch by Auris Health; Ion Endoluminal System by Intuitive Surgical). Data summarized include navigation success, diagnostic yield, and complications, as reported in included studies and trials.",
      "results": "Monarch platform: Cadaver REACH study showed farther airway generation reach (9th vs 6th) versus conventional thin bronchoscope. Human feasibility (Rojas-Solano et al.) obtained samples in 14/15 patients without pneumothorax or significant bleeding. ACCESS cadaver study demonstrated diagnostic yield of 63/67 with TBNA, increasing to 65/67 with addition of forceps; eccentric r-EBUS view yield 47/48. Multicenter retrospective post-marketing series (165 patients, 167 lesions) reported 88.6% navigation success, conservative diagnostic yield 69.1%, pneumothorax 3.6%, bleeding 2.4% (counts not provided). BENEFIT interim analysis reported lesion localization 96% in 56 patients, pneumothorax in 2 patients with 1 chest tube. Ion system: First human study (Fielding et al.) achieved target and obtained samples in 28/29 patients; overall diagnostic yield reported as 79.3% and malignancy diagnostic yield 88% (counts not provided). Cadaver Precision-1 study reported higher nodule localization and successful puncture with RAB vs EMN and UTB-rEBUS, with statistically significant differences; raw counts not reported in the review text."
