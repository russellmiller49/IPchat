      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPL) continues to present clinical challenges. Despite extensive experience with guided bronchoscopy, the diagnostic yield has not improved significantly. Robotic-assisted bronchoscopic platforms have been developed potentially to improve the diagnostic yield for PPL. Presently, limited data exist that evaluate the performance of robotic systems in live human subjects. RESEARCH QUESTION: What is the safety and feasibility of robotic-assisted bronchoscopy in patients with PPLs? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective, multicenter pilot and feasibility study that used a robotic bronchoscopic system with a mother-daughter configuration in patients with PPL 1 to 5 cm in size. The primary end points were successful lesion localization with the use of radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) imaging and incidence of procedure related adverse events. Robotic bronchoscopy was performed in patients with the use of direct visualization, electromagnetic navigation, and fluoroscopy. After the use of R-EBUS imaging, transbronchial needle aspiration was performed. Rapid on-site evaluation (ROSE) was used on all cases. Transbronchial needle aspiration alone was sufficient when ROSE was diagnostic; when ROSE was not diagnostic, transbronchial biopsy was performed with the use of the robotic platform, followed by conventional guided bronchoscopic approaches at the discretion of the investigator. RESULTS: Fifty-five patients were enrolled at five centers. One patient withdrew consent, which left 54 patients for data analysis. Median lesion size was 23 mm (interquartile range, 15 to 29 mm). R-EBUS images were available in 53 of 54 cases. Lesion localization was successful in 51 of 53 patients (96.2%). Pneumothorax was reported in two of 54 of the cases (3.7%); tube thoracostomy was required in one of the cases (1.9%). No additional adverse events occurred. INTERPRETATION: This is the first, prospective, multicenter study of robotic bronchoscopy in patients with PPLs. Successful lesion localization was achieved in 96.2% of cases, with an adverse event rate comparable with conventional bronchoscopic procedures. Additional large prospective studies are warranted to evaluate procedure characteristics, such as diagnostic yield. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov; No.: NCT03727425.",
      "methods": "This was a multicenter, prospective pilot study of robotic bronchoscopy in patients with peripheral pulmonary lesions 1 to 5 cm in size and no evidence of disease in mediastinal or hilar lymph nodes by CT or PET imaging. CT scans were performed with the use of a standardized protocol with slice thickness of 1 to 1.25 mm, with variations dependent on the manufacturer of the CT scanner. Five study sites participated; each site enrolled 11 study patients. Consecutive patients who met inclusion and exclusion criteria were considered for this study. All study procedures were performed with general anesthesia in a dedicated operating room or endoscopy suite. Flexible bronchoscopy with airway inspection was performed initially. The robotic bronchoscopic system (Monarch; Auris Health) was connected to the existing endotracheal tube. The system uses an outer sheath (6.0 mm outer diameter) and inner scope (4.4 mm outer diameter) with a 2.1-mm working channel, with electromagnetic navigation and fluoroscopic guidance. Once positioned at the target, a radial endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) probe was used to confirm lesion localization (concentric or eccentric view). Biopsy was performed with three transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) passes followed by ROSE; if nondiagnostic, three transbronchial biopsies were obtained. Crossover to conventional guided bronchoscopy was permitted if ROSE and robotic biopsies were nondiagnostic. All patients had postprocedure chest radiography within 2 hours.",
      "results": "Fifty-five patients were enrolled; one withdrew consent, leaving 54 for analysis. Median lesion size was 23 mm (IQR 15 to 29). R-EBUS images were available in 53 of 54 cases. Lesion localization was confirmed with R-EBUS in 51 of 53 patients (96.2%; 95% CI, 86.5 to 99.7). Concentric views were obtained in 31 of 51 cases (60.8%), eccentric in 20 of 51 cases (39.2%). Median time to lesion confirmation was 13 minutes (IQR 10 to 24). Pneumothorax occurred in 2 of 54 cases (3.7%; 95% CI, 0.3 to 13.3), requiring tube thoracostomy in 1 case (1.9%; 95% CI, <0.01 to 10.7). No other significant adverse events or airway trauma were observed. Median robotic procedure time was 51 minutes (IQR 44 to 64). Median insertion depth by bronchus generation was 5.5 (IQR 5 to 7). Median distance from the tip of the robotic scope to the lesion center was 23 mm (IQR 14 to 32). Diagnostic yield at 12 months was 40 of 54 (74.1%; 95% CI, 61 to 84). Diagnostic yield with a concentric R-EBUS view was 25 of 31 (80.6%) versus 14 of 20 (70.0%) with an eccentric view (P = .502). Crossover procedures were performed in five patients; one was diagnostic with thin bronchoscopy and R-EBUS TBNA. In another case, the final cytology from the robotic procedure was positive although the crossover was nondiagnostic; in three cases both were nondiagnostic."
