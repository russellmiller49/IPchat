      "abstract": "Objective: To identify the indications, complications and outcome of patients of LTS managed with Montgomery T-tube stenting and review the current literature about the role of stenting in LTS. Methods: Retrospective chart reviews of 39 patients of laryngotracheal stenosis managed by T-tube stenting for temporary or definitive treatment during the period 2004-2011 were considered. The data on indications for stenting, type of stent, problems/complications of stenting, duration of stenting, additional intervention and outcome of management were collected, tabulated and analyzed. Results: Of the 51 cases of laryngotracheal stenosis 39 patients were treated by Montgomery T-tube stenting. There was no mortality associated with the procedure or stenting. 82% of the patients were successfully decannulated. The problems and complications encountered were crusting within the tube in 44% and granulation at the subglottis in 33%. Two patients had complication due to T-tube itself: One patient developed tracheomalacia and the other had stenosis at both ends of the T-tube. Conclusion: Stenting still has a role in management of inoperable or in some deadlock situations where resection anastomosis is not feasible. It is easier to introduce the stent and to maintain it. Complications are minor and can be managed easily. It is safe for long term use. We emphasize that the treating surgeon needs to use prudence while treating stenosis using stents.",
      "methods": "Retrospective chart review of patients with laryngotracheal stenosis (LTS) managed at a tertiary center from 2004-2011. After LTS diagnosis, flexible and rigid endoscopy assessed vocal cord movement, stenosis type/grade/length, and posterior glottic/subglottic involvement; CT with 3D reconstruction was also obtained. Management decisions were individualized. Of 51 LTS patients, 5 were excluded (non-T-tube management) and 7 of 8 resection-anastomosis patients were excluded; 1 with wound dehiscence subsequently required T-tube and was included. A total of 39 patients treated with Montgomery T-tube (temporary or definitive) were analyzed. T-tube insertion was via tracheostoma with endoscopic guidance, addressing stenosis/granulation as needed. Follow-up included T-tube inspection/change at 6-12 months and assessment for decannulation; stoma closure was delayed 10 days post-decannulation to monitor for narrowing.",
      "results": "Among 39 patients, 32 developed LTS post-endotracheal intubation (21 emergency, 11 elective), 6 post-tracheostomy, and 1 due to thyroid malignancy infiltrating trachea (palliative). The most common site in post-intubation cases was trachea (48.5%); all tracheostomized cases had suprastomal stenosis. Thirty-eight had normal vocal cord mobility; 1 had restricted right vocal cord mobility. Complications included crusting/mucus plug in 17/39 (43.58%), granulation tissue in 14/39 (33.33%), persistent cough in 2/39 (5.1%), surgical emphysema in 2/39 (5.1%), bronchial intubation of the lower end in 1/39 (2.6%), clots/mucus plug causing obstruction in 1/39 (2.6%), hoarseness in 1/39 (2.6%), lower respiratory tract infection in 3/39 (7.7%), tracheobronchitis in 3/39 (7.7%), aspiration in 4/39 (10.3%), tracheomalacia in 1/39 (2.6%), restenosis at ends in 1/39 (2.6%), and displacement of tube in 1/39 (2.6%). Thirty-two patients (82.05%) were successfully decannulated and doing well after 6 months of follow-up; three patients remained on T-tube, one required permanent tracheostomy, and three died due to comorbidities unrelated to stenting. No procedure- or stent-related mortality was observed. Among those decannulated (n=32), mean stenting duration was 10.15 months (SD 8.6; range 2-36)."
