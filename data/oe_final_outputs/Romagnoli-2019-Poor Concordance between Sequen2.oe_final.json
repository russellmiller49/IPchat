      "abstract": "Rationale: The diagnostic concordance between transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) versus surgical lung biopsy (SLB) as the current gold standard in interstitial lung disease (ILD) cases requiring histology remains controversial. Objectives: To assess diagnostic concordance between TBLC and SLB sequentially performed in the same patients, the diagnostic yield of both techniques, and subsequent changes in multidisciplinary assessment (MDA) decisions. Methods: A two-center prospective study included patients with ILD with a nondefinite usual interstitial pneumonia pattern on high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) confirmed at a first MDA. Patients underwent TBLC immediately followed by video-assisted thoracoscopy for SLB at the same anatomical locations. After open reading of both sample types by local pathologists and final diagnosis at a second MDA (MDA2), anonymized TBLC and SLB slides were blindly assessed by an external expert pathologist. Kappa-concordance coefficients and percentage agreement were computed for TBLC versus SLB, MDA2 versus TBLC, MDA2 versus SLB, and blinded pathology versus routine pathology. Measurements and Main Results: Twenty-one patients were included. The median TBLC biopsy size (longest axis) was 7 mm (interquartile range, 5-8 mm). SLB biopsy sizes averaged 46.1 ± 13.8 mm. Concordance coefficients and percentage agreement were: TBLC versus SLB: κ = 0.22 (95% CI, 0.01-0.44), percentage agreement = 38% (95% CI, 18-62%); MDA2 versus TBLC: κ = 0.31 (95% CI, 0.06-0.56), percentage agreement = 48% (95% CI, 26-70%); MDA2 versus SLB: κ = 0.51 (95% CI, 0.27-0.75), percentage agreement = 62% (95% CI, 38-82%). Two pneumothoraces (9.5%) were recorded during TBLC. TBLC would have led to a different treatment if SLB was not performed in 11 of 21 (52%) cases. Conclusions: Pathological results from TBLC and SLB were poorly concordant in the assessment of ILD. SLBs were more frequently concordant with the final diagnosis retained at MDA.",
      "methods": "Prospective two-center study (Montpellier, France; Bologna, Italy). Adults with ILD and nondefinite UIP pattern on HRCT at initial MDA (MDA1) and histology indicated underwent sequential TBLC under rigid bronchoscopy and deep sedation, followed immediately by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) SLB under general anesthesia, targeting the same lobes/segments. Inclusion required FVC > 50% predicted, DLCO > 35% predicted, and echocardiographic systolic pulmonary artery pressure < 40 mm Hg. Exclusions: coagulopathy (platelets < 70,000×10^9/L; INR > 1.5), FEV1 < 1 L, diffuse bullous disease on HRCT, hemodynamic instability, severe hypoxemia (PaO2 55 mm Hg on room air), and other specified reasons at screening. Local pathologists rendered routine diagnoses (unblinded to sample type), followed by a second MDA (MDA2) for final diagnosis and management. Subsequently, an external expert pathologist, blinded to clinical data and sample pairing, reviewed anonymized TBLC and SLB slides. Kappa and percentage agreement were computed for TBLC vs SLB and for each modality vs MDA2. Statistical analyses used R; paired t test or Wilcoxon for quantitative comparisons; kappa with 95% CIs and percent agreement reported.",
      "results": "Sixty-two patients were screened; 21 were included and underwent both TBLC and SLB. A total of 97 cryobiopsies (median 5 per patient; median longest axis 7 mm [IQR 5-8 mm]) and 42 surgical lung biopsies (mean size 46.1 ± 13.8 mm) were obtained, generally from two different lobes in the same session. Blinded expert pathology showed TBLC and SLB were fully concordant in 8 of 21 cases (38%; 95% CI 18-62%), with κ = 0.22 (95% CI 0.01-0.44). TBLC was nondiagnostic in 4 of 21 cases (19%); SLB was diagnostic in all 21 of 21 cases (100%). Agreement with final MDA2 diagnosis was 48% for TBLC (10 of 21; κ = 0.31; 95% CI 0.06-0.56) and 62% for SLB (13 of 21; κ = 0.51; 95% CI 0.27-0.75). TBLC alone would have led to a different treatment in 11 of 21 patients (52%) if SLB had not been performed. Procedure durations were similar (TBLC 33.29 ± 8.22 minutes vs SLB 34.57 ± 15.65 minutes; paired t test p = 0.737). Two pneumothoraces (9.5%) occurred during TBLC; no additional serious complications were detailed."
