      "abstract": "Background: Patients with a primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) who are treated with chest tube drainage are traditionally connected to an analogue chest drainage system, containing a water seal and using a visual method of monitoring air leakage. Electronic systems with continuous digital monitoring of air leakage provide better insight into actual air leakage and changes in leakage over time, which may lead to a shorter length of hospital stay. Methods: We performed a randomized controlled trial comparing the digital with analogue system, with the aim of demonstrating that use of a digital drainage system in PSP leads to a shorter hospital stay. Results: In 102 patients enrolled with PSP we found no differences in total duration of chest tube drainage and hospital stay between the groups. However, in a post-hoc analysis, excluding 19 patients needing surgery due to prolonged air leakage, hospital stay was significantly shorter in the digital group (median 1 days, IQR 1-5 days) compared to the analogue group (median 3 days, IQR 2-5 days) (p 0.014). Treatment failure occurred in 3 patients in both groups; the rate of recurrence within 12 weeks was not significantly different between groups (16% in the digital group versus 8% in the analogue group, p 0.339). Conclusion: Length of hospital stay was not shorter in patients with PSP when applying a digital drainage system compared to an analogue drainage system. However, in the large subgroup of uncomplicated PSP, a significant reduction in duration of drainage and hospital stay was demonstrated with digital drainage. These findings suggest that digital drainage may be a practical alternative to manual aspiration in the management of PSP.",
      "methods": "The Dutch Pneumothorax Study was a multicentre, randomized controlled trial in five Dutch hospitals (2012-2017) comparing digital (Thopaz, Medela) versus locally available analogue water-seal drainage systems in adults (≥18 years) with primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) requiring chest tube drainage. Randomization was centralized via a web-based system. Exclusions: recurrent pneumothorax (referred directly to surgery), respiratory failure, ICU admission, uncontrolled bleeding tendency. Management algorithm: both groups on water seal; air leak assessed three times daily. Removal criteria: analogue—no visible bubbling; digital—air leak <15 mL/min; plus chest X-ray longest distance <2 cm. If pneumothorax >2 cm, clamping for 4 h with repeat X-ray; if stable, remove; if increase, unclamp and continue water seal. Persistent air leak >72 h triggered thoracic surgery consult; subsequent management (including suction) per clinician. Follow-up: clinic visit with chest X-ray at 4 weeks; telephone at 12 weeks for recurrence. Primary outcome: length of hospital stay (LOS). Secondary: treatment failure (clinically relevant recurrence within 1 week after discharge), recurrence within 12 weeks requiring intervention (aspiration, drainage, thoracoscopy or surgery), duration of chest tube drainage, number of chest X-rays, and number undergoing surgery. Analyses followed intention-to-treat with allowance for crossover; nonparametric tests and Fisher’s exact/Chi-square used as appropriate; p<0.05 considered significant.",
      "results": "A total of 102 patients were randomized: analogue n=50; digital n=52. Baseline characteristics were similar except for BMI. Crossover from analogue to digital occurred in 4 patients; crossover from digital to analogue occurred once post-surgery. In the full cohort, total duration of chest tube drainage and LOS did not differ: LOS median 3 (IQR 2-6) days in analogue vs 2.5 (IQR 1-14) days in digital (p=0.640). Nineteen patients underwent surgery for prolonged air leak (analogue 6, digital 13; p=0.127). In a post-hoc subgroup excluding those with prolonged air leak (analogue n=44, digital n=39), LOS was shorter with digital: median 1 (IQR 1-5) vs 3 (IQR 2-5) days (p=0.014); chest tube duration also shorter: median 1 (IQR 1-3) vs 3 (IQR 2-5) days (p=0.024). Treatment failure within 1 week after discharge occurred in 3/50 (6%) analogue vs 3/52 (6%) digital (p>0.999). Recurrence within 12 weeks (excluding those with treatment failure and with 3 missing follow-ups in the digital group) occurred in 7/47 (16%) analogue vs 4/46 (8%) digital (p=0.339)."
