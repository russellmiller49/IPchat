      "abstract": "Background: The use of self-expandable metallic stents (SEMS) in benign airway disease was the object of a boxed warning from the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2005 due to the risk of stent-related complications and difficulties associated with their removal. Third-generation fully covered SEMS have been commercialized since this warning and theoretically should not present the same difficulties associated with removal as they cannot become embedded in the airway mucosa. Objectives: We aimed to examine the safety and efficacy of a specific third-generation SEMS, the Silmet stent. Methods: We reviewed the records of all patients treated for benign airway stenosis with third-generation Silmet SEMS from January 2011 to December 2015 at the North Hospital of Marseilles, France. Results: Forty SEMS were inserted in 30 patients over this period. Twenty (50.0%) stents were removed because of stent-related complications after a median of 77.0 ± 96.6 days (migration 32.5%, granulation tissue formation 7.5%, subjective intolerance 5.0%, mucus plugging 2.5%, laryngeal edema 2.5%). There were no cases of stent-related mortality. All complications were managed successfully endoscopically. Thirty-six stents (90.0%) were removed successfully after a median of 122.0 ± 113.2 days without any complications. The clinical success rate of stent treatment was 40.7%. Conclusion: Third-generation SEMS are a safe treatment option for complex benign airway stenosis, but complications requiring stent removal are frequent. Further studies are needed to compare the performance of third-generation SEMS and silicone stents in benign airway stenosis.",
      "methods": "We reviewed the charts and electronic records of all patients treated with fully covered Silmet (Novatech, La Ciotat, France) SEMS for benign airway stenosis from January 2011 to December 2015 at the Hôpital Nord de l’Assistance Publique des Hôpitaux de Marseille. Data included demographics, etiology and site of stenosis, prior treatments, stent characteristics, technical success, complications, dwell time, removal and its complications, and need for further intervention. Stenosis with an element of malacia was classified as complex. Usual follow-up included visits at 1, 6, and 12 months, then annually; no systematic follow-up bronchoscopy unless symptomatic. Stent removal was attempted after 6-12 months unless high risk of recurrence. Clinical success was defined as successful stent removal followed by no need for further intervention for at least 1 year or a stent left in place indefinitely without complication. Fisher exact test compared clinical success rates across etiologies, sites, and previous treatment status; p values <0.05 were considered significant. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia using rigid bronchoscopy with direct visualization.",
      "results": "Forty Silmet stents were implanted in 30 patients; all 30 had complex stenosis. Technical success of stent placement was 100% with no procedural complications. Stent-related complications leading to removal occurred in 20/40 (50.0%) stents after a median 77.0 ± 96.6 days: migration 13/40 (32.5%), granulation tissue requiring intervention 3/40 (7.5%), subjective intolerance 2/40 (5.0%), mucus plugging requiring bronchoscopy 1/40 (2.5%), and laryngeal edema 1/40 (2.5%). No stent-related mortality occurred; all complications were managed endoscopically. Thirty-six stents (90.0%) were removed successfully after a median of 122.0 ± 113.2 days without complications. Thirteen patients had an elective removal trial after median dwell time 223.5 ± 95.8 days; 9/13 (69.2%) required no further intervention, 4/13 (30.8%) had recurrence (2 surgical treatment; 2 new SEMS). Two patients had stents left in place indefinitely without complications during 433 and 455 days of follow-up. Two patients died of unrelated causes with stents in place without stent-related complications. Clinical success was 11/27 (40.7%) after excluding 2 unrelated deaths and 1 bridge-to-surgery case. Success did not differ by etiology, site, or previous treatment (p = 0.39, p = 0.55, p = 0.37). Six patients underwent surgical resection after endoscopic failure; 5/6 had no complications and 1/6 had restenosis at the anastomosis."
