      "abstract": "Background: Prior to the 1980s, permanent feeding tube placement was limited to an open surgical procedure until Gauderer and colleagues described the safe placement of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tubes. This procedure has since expanded beyond the realm of surgeons to include gastroenterologists, thoracic surgeons, and interventional radiologists. In some academic centers, interventional pulmonologists (IPs) also perform this procedure. We describe the safety and feasibility of PEG tube placement by IPs in a critically ill population. Methods: Prospectively collected data of patients in a medical ICU undergoing PEG tube placement from 2003 to 2007 at a tertiary-care center were reviewed. Inclusion criteria included all PEG tube insertions performed or attempted by the IP team. Data were collected on mortality, PEG tube removal rate, total number of days with PEG tube, and complication rates. Follow-up included hospital length of stay and phone contact after discharge. Procedural and long-term PEG-related complications were recorded. Results: Seventy-two patients were studied. PEG tube insertion was completed successfully in 70 (97.2%), with follow-up data in 69 of these 70. Thirty-day mortality was approximately 11% with eight deaths. No deaths or immediate complications were attributed to PEG tube placement. PEG tube removal occurred in 27 patients, with a median time to removal of 76 days. Conclusions: Bedside PEG tube placement can be performed safely and effectively by trained IPs. Because percutaneous tracheostomy is currently performed by IPs, the ability to place both PEG and tracheostomy tubes at the same time has the potential for decreased costs, anesthesia exposure, procedural times, ventilator times, and ICU days.",
      "methods": "Prospective database review of all PEG placements performed or attempted by the interventional pulmonology team in a single tertiary-care medical ICU from February 2003 to April 2007. All procedures were performed at the bedside under anesthesiologist-administered IV anesthesia and muscle relaxation. Prophylactic antibiotics were used per guidelines. The pull-through technique was used with commercial PEG kits. Enteral feeding was allowed 4 hours post-procedure unless clinically contraindicated. Outcomes collected: mortality, PEG removal rate, total PEG days, procedural and long-term complications. Procedural complications defined as bleeding (requiring suturing, packing, transfusion, or surgery), inability to complete the procedure once an abdominal incision was made, unintentional abdominal organ puncture, or death within 24 hours. Long-term complications included cellulitis, peritonitis, and PEG malfunction. Mortality rates were estimated by Kaplan-Meier. Credentialing required supervision of the first 20 PEGs by surgeons/gastroenterologists; thereafter IPs performed independently.",
      "results": "Seventy-two patients (median age 70 years; 40 women) were included. PEG was successfully completed in 70/72 (97.2%). Follow-up was available in 69/70 successful cases. No immediate procedural complications or procedure-attributed deaths occurred. One minor long-term complication (cellulitis) occurred (approximately 1.4%). Thirty-day mortality was reported as ~11% (eight patients). One-year mortality was reported as 33 deaths; the table shows 47.1% (33/70), while narrative text notes a Kaplan-Meier estimate of 75.7%. PEG tube removal occurred in 27 patients; median time to removal 76 days. Median PEG days 90; median follow-up 91 days. Mean procedure duration after initial 20 cases was 15.8 minutes (range 8-25). Two procedures were aborted (inadequate transillumination; inability to advance gastroscope)."
