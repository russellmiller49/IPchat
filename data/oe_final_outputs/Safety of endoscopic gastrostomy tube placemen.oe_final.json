      "abstract": "Background and Aims: A gastrostomy tube is often required for inpatients requiring long-term nutritional access. We compared the safety and outcomes of 3 techniques for performing a gastrostomy: percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), fluoroscopy-guided gastrostomy by an interventional radiologist (IR-gastrostomy), and open gastrostomy performed by a surgeon (surgical gastrostomy). Methods: Using the Nationwide Readmissions Database, we identified hospitalized patients who underwent a gastrostomy from 2016 to 2017 using ICD-10-PCS codes and grouped them as PEG (0DH64UZ), IR-gastrostomy (0DH63UZ), or open surgical gastrostomy (0DH60UZ). Adjusted odds ratios were estimated via multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among 184,068 patients, 16,384 had PEG (mean age 53.7), 154,007 IR-gastrostomy (mean age 67.2), and 13,677 surgical gastrostomy (mean age 57.9). Compared with PEG, adjusted odds for colon perforation were higher with IR-gastrostomy (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.26-2.86; p=.002) and surgical gastrostomy (OR 6.65, 95% CI 4.38-10.12; p<.001); for gastrostomy infection, IR-gastrostomy OR 1.28 (95% CI 1.07-1.53; p=.006) and surgical OR 1.61 (95% CI 1.29-2.01; p<.001); for hemorrhage requiring transfusion, IR-gastrostomy OR 1.84 (95% CI 1.26-2.68; p=.002) and surgical OR 1.09 (95% CI 0.64-1.86; p=.746); for 30-day nonelective readmission, IR-gastrostomy OR 1.07 (95% CI 1.03-1.12; p=.0023) and surgical OR 1.13 (95% CI 1.06-1.2; p=.0002); and for inpatient mortality, IR-gastrostomy OR 1.09 (95% CI 1.02-1.17; p=.0114) and surgical OR 1.55 (95% CI 1.42-1.69; p<.0001). Overall adverse events occurred in 10,019/184,068 (5.4%). Conclusions: Endoscopic PEG placement was associated with lower risks of inpatient adverse events, mortality, and readmission compared with IR-gastrostomy and surgical gastrostomy.",
      "methods": "Retrospective analysis of the U.S. Nationwide Readmissions Database (2016-2017). Inpatients undergoing gastrostomy were identified by ICD-10-PCS: PEG (0DH64UZ), IR-gastrostomy (0DH63UZ), and open surgical gastrostomy (0DH60UZ). Exclusions included ICD-10-PCS codes 0DH68UZ and 0DH67UZ (use of natural or artificial opening) and bypass procedures. Comorbidities were identified using AHRQ comorbidity measures (29 conditions). Readmission was defined as a nonelective admission within 30 days after discharge; patients who died in index admission and those with December admissions were excluded from the readmission denominator. Multivariable logistic regression modeled adverse outcomes with procedure type as the primary variable, adjusted for age, sex, 29 comorbidities, hospital ownership, and teaching status. Analyses used SAS 9.4. Two-sided p<.05 considered significant.",
      "results": "A total of 184,068 patients met criteria: PEG n=16,384 (mean age 53.7, 46% women), IR-gastrostomy n=154,007 (mean age 67.2, 44% women), surgical gastrostomy n=13,677 (mean age 57.9, 46.3% women). Overall adverse events occurred in 10,019 (5.4%): 957/16,384 (5.84%) PEG, 7,722/154,007 (5.01%) IR-gastrostomy, and 1,340/13,677 (9.8%) surgical. The most common event was gastrostomy tube malfunction (52%) followed by infection (19%). Adjusted odds versus PEG: colon perforation higher with IR-gastrostomy (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.26-2.86; p=.002) and surgical (OR 6.65, 95% CI 4.38-10.12; p<.001); gastrostomy infection higher with IR-gastrostomy (OR 1.28, 95% CI 1.07-1.53; p=.006) and surgical (OR 1.61, 95% CI 1.29-2.01; p<.001); hemorrhage requiring transfusion higher with IR-gastrostomy (OR 1.84, 95% CI 1.26-2.68; p=.002) but not with surgical (OR 1.09, 95% CI 0.64-1.86; p=.746). Adjusted odds of 30-day nonelective readmission were higher with IR-gastrostomy (OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.03-1.12; p=.0023) and surgical (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.06-1.2; p=.0002) versus PEG. Adjusted odds of inpatient mortality were higher with IR-gastrostomy (OR 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.17; p=.0114) and surgical (OR 1.55, 95% CI 1.42-1.69; p<.0001) versus PEG."
