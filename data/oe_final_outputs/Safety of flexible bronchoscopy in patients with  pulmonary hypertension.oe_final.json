      "abstract": "Background: The presence of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and treatment with anticoagulant agents could potentially increase the risk for bleeding/hemodynamic complications associated with bronchoscopic procedures. The aim of this study was to assess the safety of diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy (FB) in patients with PH. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical records of patients with echocardiographic evidence of PH (right ventricular systolic pressure [RVSP] ≥ 40 mm Hg) who underwent diagnostic FB between 2004 and 2016 at a single facility in Japan was conducted. Patients with no clinical evidence suggestive of PH who underwent FB during the same period were enrolled as a pairwise-matched control group; factors used in matching included age, sex, and performed procedures. Results: Overall, there were 45 patients in the PH group and 90 patients in the control group. Six (13%) patients in the PH group had severe PH (RVSP ≥ 61 mm Hg). Forceps biopsies and transbronchial needle aspirations were performed in 62% and 13% of patients, respectively, in the PH group, and 58% and 13% of patients, respectively, in the control group. The total incidence of bleeding during FB was not significantly different between the two groups (18% versus 16%; p = 0.742). Vital signs recorded 2 h after FB were also not significantly different between the two groups. There were no episodes of cardiac arrhythmias or deaths associated with the FB procedures. Conclusions: The data suggest that diagnostic FB procedures can be performed safely in patients with echocardiographic evidence of PH.",
      "methods": "Study design: Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database and medical records at Chiba University Hospital. Patients who underwent diagnostic FB between April 2004 and December 2016 and had echocardiography within 3 months of FB were included. PH was defined as RVSP ≥ 40 mm Hg by Doppler echocardiography. Controls were pairwise matched 1:2 (age, sex, and procedures performed) and had no clinical evidence of PH. FB procedures included EBB, TBB, TBNA (including EBUS-TBNA), BAL, brushing, and observation. Monitoring included ECG, pulse oximetry, and noninvasive BP; oxygen at 2 L/min was given via nasal cannula. Conscious sedation with IV midazolam and/or pethidine; topical 1% lidocaine. Antithrombotic agents were routinely withdrawn; high embolic risk patients on oral anticoagulants received heparin bridging (stopped 4 h before FB, resumed immediately after). Complications were defined a priori: bleeding (mild = need for continuous suctioning; moderate = need to wedge bronchoscope; severe = need for additional interventions/ICU), hypoxemia (need for supplemental O2 by mask or intubation), hypotension (SBP < 80 mm Hg or vasopressor use), arrhythmias (new dysrhythmias). Statistical analysis used chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests for categorical variables and t-test or Mann-Whitney for continuous variables; two-sided p<0.05 threshold; SAS 9.4.",
      "results": "A total of 45 PH patients and 90 matched controls were analyzed. PH severity: mild 28 (62%), moderate 11 (24%), severe 6 (13%). PH clinical classification: group 1 22 (49%), group 2 10 (22%), group 3 8 (18%), group 4 5 (11%). Antithrombotic agent use was higher in PH vs controls (44% vs 20%; p = 0.003); heparin bridging was more frequent (18% vs 2%; p = 0.002). EBB/TBB was performed in 62% (PH) vs 58% (controls); TBNA in 13% vs 13%; BAL in 38% vs 38%. Sedation doses were similar. Complications (PH vs control): any bleeding 8/45 (18%) vs 14/90 (16%), p = 0.742; mild bleeding 6/45 (13%) vs 12/90 (13%); moderate bleeding 2/45 (4%) vs 3/90 (3%); severe bleeding 0 vs 0. Hypoxemia 2/45 (4%) vs 5/90 (6%), p = 1.000. Hypotension 0/45 (0%) vs 1/90 (1%), p = 1.000. Arrhythmias 0 vs 0. No deaths or need for mechanical ventilation occurred. Late complications within 2 weeks: pneumonia 1 (PH) and ILD exacerbation 1 (control). In PH patients undergoing biopsy, bleeding occurred in moderate PH but not severe PH; no bleeding when a guide sheath was used. Vital signs 2 h post-FB did not differ significantly between groups."
