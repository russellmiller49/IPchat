      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess the different methods of percutaneous tracheostomy in terms of successful performance of the tracheostomy as well as safety. Tracheostomy is the most common procedure performed on the airway for patients in ICUs. Lately, several methods of percutaneous tracheostomy (multiple dilator, progressive dilator, forceps dilation, screw-like dilation, balloon dilation, and translaryngeal) have been described, with theoretical advantages, but there is no consensus about which is better. METHODS: A systematic review with critical appraisal of the literature was done. Literature in multiple databases was searched. Randomized controlled trials comparing different tracheostomy methods were selected. Clinical and methodological characteristics were assessed. A meta-analysis using fixed effect models was planned for statistically homogeneous outcomes. RESULTS: Fourteen randomized controlled trials were included, most of them with small sample sizes and with comparisons of multiple methods. Blue Rhino methods were less difficult for surgeons (risk difference of 14.7% [95% CI 8-21.5]) and had more minor bleeding events (risk difference of -6.3% [95% CI -13.58 to 0.8]). There were no differences in major bleeding events. Statistically, heterogeneity and lack of data impede comparison with other outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The Blue Rhino method is less difficult and has more minor bleeding events, but physicians also have more experience with this technique. However, trials are underpowered to define the best method.",
      "methods": "A search was conducted on the MEDLINE, LILACS, Embase, and Cochrane Collaboration databases for randomized controlled trials published between January 1985 and November 2013 using the terms tracheostomy, tracheotomy, clinical trial, and percutaneous. References were explored to identify other articles. Only studies published in English were included. Inclusion criteria: RCTs of adult ICU subjects undergoing elective tracheostomy. Exclusion criteria: contraindications to percutaneous tracheostomy such as local infection, bleeding disorders, malignant cervical tumors, and spinal trauma. Methods analyzed: Ciaglia multiple dilator, Ciaglia Blue Rhino (single progressive dilator), Ciaglia balloon dilator, Griggs (dilating forceps), Fantoni (translaryngeal), and PercuTwist (screw-like dilator). Main outcomes: complications and difficulty/impossibility to perform the procedure. Complications were classified as major (bleeding requiring any intervention, those defined as major by original authors, or posterior tracheal tears) and minor (limited bleeding). Follow-up was until death or ICU discharge. Difficulty was classified subjectively by most authors; a negative outcome was defined as highly difficult or impossible tracheostomy or need to change the method. Risk differences (95% CI) were calculated using Mantel-Haenszel fixed effects when heterogeneity allowed (I2 ≤ 50%). Heterogeneity was assessed with Q test (P ≤ 0.05) and I2. Sensitivity analyses and subgroup analyses by antegrade vs retrograde and by dilation technique were planned.",
      "results": "A total of 14 RCTs directly compared 2 percutaneous tracheostomy methods. Most trials had small samples and compared multiple methods. Pooled estimates showed Blue Rhino methods were less difficult for operators (risk difference 14.7% [95% CI 8-21.5], indicating fewer difficulty events with Blue Rhino when using the review’s RD convention) and had more minor bleeding events (risk difference -6.3% [95% CI -13.58 to 0.8], indicating more minor bleeding with Blue Rhino under the review’s RD convention). No statistically significant differences were found in major bleeding. Heterogeneity and lack of detailed data impeded robust comparisons for several outcomes. Individual trials noted specific findings: Blue Rhino vs multiple dilator showed a significant reduction in tracheal ring fractures; Blue Rhino vs Blue Dolphin (balloon) showed longer operating time and more difficulty and minor bleeding with Blue Dolphin; Blue Rhino vs Griggs showed mixed peri-procedural physiologic effects and isolated complications (e.g., surgical emphysema 3 vs 0 with Griggs vs Blue Rhino in one RCT)."
