      "abstract": "Background: Pleural effusions may be aspirated manually or via vacuum during thoracentesis. This study compares the safety, pain level, and time involved for these techniques. Methods: We randomized 100 patients receiving ultrasound-guided unilateral thoracentesis in an academic medical center from December 2015 through September 2017 to either vacuum or manual drainage. Without using pleural manometry, the effusion was drained completely or until development of refractory symptoms. Measurements included self-reported pain before and during the procedure (from 0-10), time for completion of drainage, and volume removed. Primary outcomes were rates of all-cause complications and of early termination of procedure with secondary outcomes of change in pain score, drainage time, volume removed, and inverse rate of removal. Results: Patient characteristics in the manual (n=49) and vacuum (n=51) groups were similar. Rate of all-cause complications was higher in the vacuum group (5 vs 0, p=0.03): pneumothorax (n=3), surgically treated hemothorax with subsequent death (n=1) and re-expansion pulmonary edema causing respiratory failure (n=1), as was rate of early termination (8 vs 1, p=0.018). The vacuum group exhibited greater pain during drainage (p<0.05), shorter drainage time (p<0.01), no association with volume removed (p>0.05), and lower inverse rate of removal (p<=0.01). Conclusion: Despite requiring less time, vacuum aspiration during thoracentesis was associated with higher rates of complication and of early termination of procedure and greater pain. While larger studies are needed, this pilot study suggests that manual aspiration provides greater safety and patient comfort.",
      "methods": "A prospective randomized single-center trial (Yale-New Haven Hospital) enrolled adult inpatients from December 2015 through September 2017 undergoing ultrasound-guided unilateral thoracentesis. Participants were randomized to manual syringe aspiration with a one-way valve and drainage bag (Safe-T-Centesis Carefusion kit) or to vacuum drainage via an evacuated container (Baxter). Pleural manometry was not used. Drainage aimed for complete evacuation; procedures were terminated early only for refractory symptoms (e.g., intolerable chest pain or cough) or device malfunction. Outcomes recorded included self-reported pain (Numeric Pain Rating Scale 0-10) before and during drainage, drainage time (seconds), and net volume removed (mL). Complications were defined a priori as post-procedure pneumothorax, hemothorax, radiographic re-expansion pulmonary edema, and post-procedure respiratory failure. Statistical analysis used t-tests for continuous variables, chi-square or Fisherâ€™s exact tests for categorical variables, and intercept-only negative binomial regression to estimate rates of primary outcomes. For secondary continuous outcomes, multivariable linear regression adjusted for exudative effusion, loculation, malignancy, and recent cardiac procedure; significant findings were checked via Wilcoxon tests. Significance threshold p<0.05.",
      "results": "One hundred patients were randomized: manual n=49, vacuum n=51, with similar baseline characteristics and predominantly exudative effusions. All-cause complications were higher with vacuum (5 vs 0, p=0.03), consisting of pneumothorax (n=3, none requiring chest tube), surgically treated hemothorax with subsequent death (n=1), and re-expansion pulmonary edema causing respiratory failure (n=1). Early termination was more frequent with vacuum (8 vs 1; p=0.02), most due to symptoms; one vacuum case was due to vacuum system malfunction. Two additional vacuum patients had pneumothorax ex vacuo related to malignancy (non-expandable lung) and were not considered complications. After multivariable adjustment, vacuum drainage was associated with greater increase in pain during drainage (approximately 1 point higher), shorter drainage time, no significant difference in volume removed, and a lower inverse rate of removal."
