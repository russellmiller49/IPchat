      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Bronchoscopy is a useful tool for the diagnosis of lesions near central airways; however, the diagnostic accuracy of these procedures for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) is a matter of ongoing debate. In this setting, electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) is a technique used to navigate and obtain samples from these lesions. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the sensitivity of ENB in patients with PPLs suspected of lung cancer. RESEARCH QUESTION: In patients with peripheral pulmonary lesion suspected of lung cancer, what is the sensitivity and safety of electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy compared to surgery or longitudinal follow up? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A comprehensive search of several databases was performed. Extracted data included sensitivity of ENB for malignancy, adequacy of the tissue sample, and complications. The study quality was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool, and the combined data were meta-analyzed using a bivariate method model. A summary receiver operatic characteristic curve (sROC) was created. Finally, the quality of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Forty studies with a total of 3,342 participants were included in our analysis. ENB reported a pooled sensitivity of 77% (95% CI, 72%-82%; I2 = 80.6%) and a specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99%-100%; I2 = 0%) for malignancy. The sROC showed an area under the curve of 0.955 (P = .03). ENB achieved a sufficient sample for ancillary tests in 90.9% (95% CI, 84.8%-96.9%; I2 = 80.7%). Risk of pneumothorax was 2.0% (95% CI, 1.0-3.0; I2 = 45.2%). We found subgroup differences according to the risk of bias and the number of sampling techniques. Meta-regression showed an association between sensitivity and the mean distance of the sensor tip to the center of the nodule, the number of tissue sampling techniques, and the cancer prevalence in the study. INTERPRETATION: ENB is very safe with good sensitivity for diagnosing malignancy in patients with PPLs. The applicability of our findings is limited because most studies were done with the superDimension navigation system and heterogeneity was high.",
      "methods": "This systematic review and meta-analysis followed PRISMA-DTA recommendations and was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42019109449). A comprehensive search of PubMed, Embase, LILACS, ClinicalTrials.gov, Cochrane Central, ScienceDirect, Scirus, ISI Web of Knowledge, and Google Scholar was performed in May 2019 and updated in November 2019 without language restrictions. Inclusion criteria: ENB used for diagnosis of PPLs; diagnosis confirmed histologically or by close clinical follow-up; clear reference standard for sensitivity. Data extracted included study characteristics, TP, FP, TN, FN, ROSE use, nodule size, fluoroscopy use, r-EBUS use, cancer prevalence, and successful navigation. Risk of bias was assessed using QUADAS-2. Meta-analyses used proportions after a binomial distribution with Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation (STATA 14.2; Open Meta Analyst). A bivariate model and sROC were generated. Heterogeneity assessed via I2 and subgroup analyses by prespecified covariates. Publication bias assessed with funnel plot and Egger test. Complementary analyses included meta-regression of sensitivity on continuous covariates (cancer prevalence, tip-to-nodule distance, procedure duration, number of sampling techniques, nodule size) and adequacy of samples for ancillary testing. Safety outcomes included pneumothorax (requiring chest tube placement), minor bleeding, major bleeding, acute respiratory failure, and need for repeat biopsy.",
      "results": "Forty studies (n = 3,342 participants) were included. Successful navigation to target lesion was 98% (3,290/3,356 PPLs). Pooled sensitivity for lung cancer was 0.77 (95% CI 0.72-0.82; I2 = 80.6%) by random effects; fixed effects 0.76 (95% CI 0.74-0.78; I2 = 0%). Pooled specificity was 1.00 (95% CI 0.99-1.00; I2 = 0%). Negative likelihood ratio 0.2 (95% CI 0.1-0.3; I2 = 0%); positive likelihood ratio 15.8 (95% CI 10.3-24.2; I2 = 0%). sROC AUC 0.955 (P = .03). Publication bias low; Egger test P = .16. Adequate sample for ancillary tests 90.9% (95% CI 84.8%-96.9%; I2 = 80.7%). Pneumothorax risk 2.0% (95% CI 1.0%-3.0%; I2 = 45.2%). Subgroup analysis by overall QUADAS-2 risk: high risk studies sensitivity 0.669 (95% CI 0.59-0.74; I2 = 78.5%) vs low risk 0.771 (95% CI 0.712-0.821; I2 = 60.2%); between-group heterogeneity P < .01. Meta-regression found sensitivity associated with smaller mean tip-to-nodule distance, greater number of sampling techniques, and higher cancer prevalence."
