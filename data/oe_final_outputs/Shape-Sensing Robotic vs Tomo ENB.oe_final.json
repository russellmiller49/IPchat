      "abstract": "Background: Digital tomosynthesis-corrected electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (DT-ENB) enables near-real-time intraprocedural visualization of peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs). Shape-sensing robotic-assisted bronchoscopy (ssRAB) offers improved catheter stability and articulation but lacks real-time localization. Research question: Does the diagnostic yield of ssRAB differ from DT-ENB for PPL biopsy? Study design and methods: Retrospective comparative cohort study of prospectively collected consecutive procedures during the first 6 months after each platform's introduction at a single center. Diagnostic yield was defined as malignancy or specific benign histopathology explaining the PPL; nonspecific inflammation, normal lung/airway, and atypia not diagnostic of malignancy were nondiagnostic. Results: ssRAB biopsied 143 PPLs in 133 patients; DT-ENB biopsied 197 PPLs in 170 patients. Diagnostic yield was 77% (110/143) for ssRAB and 80% (158/197) for DT-ENB (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.4; P = .4). Median lesion diameters were 17 mm (ssRAB) and 19 mm (DT-ENB). After adjustment for lesion size, bronchus sign, location (peripheral vs middle third), and sex, results were similar (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.49-1.6; P = .6). Pneumothorax occurred in 1.5% (2/133) with ssRAB and 1.8% (3/170) with DT-ENB (P = .86). Interpretation: ssRAB and DT-ENB had comparable diagnostic performance and safety using a conservative diagnostic yield definition.",
      "methods": "Design: Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data for consecutive navigational bronchoscopies within the first 6 months after introduction of each platform at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Platforms and windows: DT-ENB introduced April 25, 2018; ssRAB introduced November 3, 2021. Patients undergoing DT-ENB during the ssRAB window only due to enrollment in a randomized trial (VERITAS, NCT04250194) were excluded. Procedures: Board-certified interventional pulmonologists or fellows under supervision performed all cases under general anesthesia with neuromuscular blockade, 8.5-mm ETT, post-intubation recruitment maneuver (40 cm H2O for 40 s), PEEP 15 cm H2O, and minimized FiO2 to limit atelectasis. DT-ENB used superDimension (Medtronic) with digital tomosynthesis. ssRAB used the ION platform (Intuitive Surgical) with PlanPoint planning and shape-sensing catheter; registration by airway maneuvering; vision probe removed for biopsy. Radial endobronchial ultrasound was used in all patients, with fluoroscopic guidance. Initial sampling by transbronchial needle aspiration (21G Arcpoint needle for DT-ENB; 19/21/23G Flexision needles for ssRAB), with ROSE; additional forceps/brush/peripheral wash at operator discretion. Outcomes: Primary—difference in diagnostic yield (lesional histopathology: malignancy or specific benign pattern). Nondiagnostic included normal lung/airway, nonspecific inflammation, atypia not diagnostic. Secondary—factors associated with yield; complications per national QI definitions. Analysis: Wilcoxon rank-sum and chi-square tests for baseline comparisons; logistic regression for platform-yield association adjusted for nodule size, bronchus sign, location (peripheral vs middle third), and sex; robust sandwich estimator for within-patient correlation (multiple PPLs). Sensitivity analysis restricted to first PPL per patient.",
      "results": "A total of 197 PPLs in 170 patients underwent DT-ENB and 143 PPLs in 133 patients underwent ssRAB within the defined 6-month periods. Median lesion sizes: 19 mm (IQR 14-28) for DT-ENB and 17 mm (IQR 12-27) for ssRAB. DT-ENB had more peripheral one-third lesions (80.7% vs 48.0%; P < .001) and more women (59.4% vs 45.1%; P = .013); bronchus sign prevalence and nodule density were similar. Primary outcome: Diagnostic yield was 80% (158/197) for DT-ENB vs 77% (110/143) for ssRAB (OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.5-1.4; P = .4). Pathology among DT-ENB cases: 54% malignant (107/197) and 26% specific benign (51/197); among ssRAB: 55% malignant (78/143) and 22% specific benign (32/143). Adjusted analysis (size, bronchus sign, location, sex): OR 0.87 (95% CI 0.49-1.6; P = .6). Sensitivity (first PPL per patient): 81% (138/170) DT-ENB vs 80% (106/133) ssRAB; OR 0.9 (95% CI 0.5-1.6; P = .7); adjusted OR 1.0 (95% CI 0.5-1.8; P = .9). Factors associated with diagnostic yield overall included larger nodule size, concentric radial EBUS view, and solid density. Platform-specific: DT-ENB—solid density (OR 4.4, 95% CI 1.9-9.9; P = .001); ssRAB—bronchus sign (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2-7.7; P = .015) and concentric radial EBUS (OR 3.5, 95% CI 1.4-8.4; P = .004). Complications: Pneumothorax in 1.5% (2/133) of ssRAB and 1.8% (3/170) of DT-ENB (P = .86); chest tube required in 2 ssRAB patients and 1 DT-ENB patient; no bleeding requiring intervention."
