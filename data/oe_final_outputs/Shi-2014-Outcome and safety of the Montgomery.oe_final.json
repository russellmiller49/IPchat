      "abstract": "Objective: We retrospectively analyzed the surgical outcome and safety of the Montgomery T-tube for laryngotracheal stenosis. Methods: The patients with laryngotracheal stenosis who had undergone T-tube placement between 1996 and 2010 were reviewed. The severity of the stenosis was evaluated using the Cotton-Myer staging method. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful extubation and the secondary endpoint was safety. Results: 546 patients were eligible. T-tubes were successfully extubated in 342 patients 6-24 months following intubation. The initial extubation success rate was 62.3%. Laryngotracheal restenosis following extubation occurred in 192 patients, necessitating T-tube placement for a second time. The success rate for the second attempt was 58.9%. The overall success rate was 83.3%. Hemoptysis was reported in 8 patients, postoperative infection in 6 patients, wound dehiscence in 3 patients, laryngeal obstruction in 13 patients, aspiration in 12 patients, and postoperative tracheoesophageal fistula in 2 patients. Conclusion: This large clinical series demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the T-tube for grade 1 and 2 stenosis with stenosed segments of <6 cm. For those being >6 cm, tracheal end-to-end anastomosis is not appropriate and long-term placement of a T-tube is recommended. Our findings provide useful guidance for preoperatively selecting patients with laryngotracheal stenosis of various causes and differing severity.",
      "methods": "Retrospective review of patients with laryngotracheal stenosis who underwent Montgomery T-tube placement between May 1996 and May 2010 at Changhai Hospital, Shanghai, China. Inclusion criteria: diagnosed laryngotracheal stenosis with cross-sectional area of stenosis >70%, progressive breathing difficulty, and apparent inflammation or granulation on tracheoscopy. Tracheoscopy was performed in all; tracheal CT reconstruction as needed. Stenosis categorized by site (tracheal, laryngeal, laryngotracheal). Severity graded by Cotton-Myer staging. T-tube placement combined with surgery based on stenosis length/extent; sizes 10/12/14 mm selected per age/sex/body size and endoscopic/CT findings. Placement after laryngotracheofissure with preservation of normal mucosa, scar excision, and cartilage reduction; tube extended ~1 cm beyond both ends of stenosis. Adjunct procedures included laryngofissure, laser scar removal, cricoidectomy with laryngofissure, cricoid widening using hyoid bone if needed, and laser arytenoidectomy for bilateral vocal cord paralysis. Follow-up: clinic visits every 3 months in year 1, then every 6 months; extubation typically 6-12 months post-placement depending on stenosis; outcomes assessed up to 24 months. Primary endpoint: successful extubation rate. Secondary endpoint: safety (complications). Statistical analysis used SPSS 16.0; chi-square tests for group differences, ANOVA for three-group comparisons; significance at p < 0.05.",
      "results": "546 patients met inclusion criteria. Median age 35 years (range 12-65); 337 male and 209 female. Causes: neck trauma 332 (60.8%), post-intubation 146 (26.7%), post-laryngotracheal tumor resection 35 (6.4%), chemical burns 25 (4.6%), unknown 8 (1.5%). Sites: tracheal 319 (58.4%), laryngeal 155 (28.4%), laryngotracheal 72 (13.2%). Cotton-Myer grade: I 338 (61.9%), II 118 (21.6%), III 69 (12.6%), IV 21 (3.9%). Mean follow-up 13 months (range 6-24); 12 (2.2%) lost to follow-up. Initial extubation success in 342 patients (62.6%) at 6-24 months post-intubation; initial success rate 62.3%. Restenosis after extubation in 192 patients (35.2%), requiring second T-tube; second extubation success in 113 (58.9%). Overall success 83.3%. By site, initial extubation success was higher in tracheal stenosis (76.2%) vs laryngeal (52.9%) and laryngotracheal (41.2%) (p < 0.05). By grade, initial success decreased with higher Cotton-Myer grades: I 70.4%, II 56.8%, III 44.9%, IV 28.6% (pairwise p < 0.05). Complications: hemoptysis 8 (1.5%), postoperative infection 6 (1.1%), wound dehiscence 3 (0.5%), laryngeal obstruction 13 (2.4%), aspiration 12 (2.2%), postoperative tracheoesophageal fistula 2 (0.4%)."
