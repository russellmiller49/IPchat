      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The outcome of indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) use in hepatic hydrothorax (HH) is unclear. This study aimed to review the safety and feasibility of the IPC in patients with refractory HH. METHODS: A retrospective multicenter study of patients with HH from January 2010 to December 2016 was performed. Inclusion criteria were refractory HH treated with an IPC and an underlying diagnosis of cirrhosis. Records were reviewed for patient demographics, operative reports, and laboratory values. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate catheter time to removal. The Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate for independent predictors of pleurodesis and death. RESULTS: Seventy-nine patients were identified from eight institutions. Indication for IPC placement was palliation in 58 patients (73%) and bridge to transplant in 21 patients (27%). The median in situ dwell time of all catheters was 156 days (range, 16-1,978 days). Eight patients (10%) were found to have pleural space infection, five of whom also had catheter-site cellulitis. Two patients (2.5%) died secondary to catheter-related sepsis. Catheter removal secondary to spontaneous pleurodesis was achieved in 22 patients (28%). Median time from catheter insertion to pleurodesis was 55 days (range, 10-370 days). Older age was an independent predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 1.05; P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: We present, to our knowledge, the first multicenter study examining outcomes related to IPC use in HH. Ten percent infection risk and 2.5% mortality were identified. IPC placement may be a reasonable clinical option for patients with refractory HH, but it is associated with significant adverse events in this morbid population.",
      "methods": "A multi-institution retrospective study of all patients with cirrhosis with HH undergoing IPC placement was performed at eight medical centers from January 2010 to December 2016. Inclusion criteria were adult age (>18 years), diagnosis of cirrhosis, refractory HH not responding to maximized sodium restriction and diuresis requiring repeated thoracenteses, and partial/no response to TIPS or contraindication to TIPS per treating team. Data collected included demographics, hepatology and operative reports, pathology, cytology, microbiology, laboratory values at IPC insertion, complications, and outcomes. Pleural space physiology (expandable vs nonexpandable lung) was documented when available. Catheters were placed by interventional pulmonology teams and drained at home every other day, with a maximum of 1 L per drainage. Time-to-event analyses used Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models. Catheter removal due to spontaneous pleurodesis was treated as the outcome of interest with infection, malfunction, and death as competing risks; competing risk time-to-event regression was applied. Variables with P < .25 in univariate models were entered into multivariate models. Statistical significance was P < .05.",
      "results": "Seventy-nine patients were identified. Mean age was 60 Â± 10.7 years; 43 (54%) were men. Prior failed TIPS was noted in 16 (20%). IPC indication was palliation in 58 (73%) and bridge to transplant in 21 (27%); 15 received liver transplant. IPC placement was right-sided in 70 (88%). Median prior thoracenteses was 5.1 (IQR 6.2), range 1-42. Pleural space physiology was reported in 65 (82%). Median catheter dwell time was 156 days (range, 15-1,978), totaling 15,025 catheter-days. The most common reason for IPC removal was death (n = 33). Spontaneous pleurodesis occurred in 22 (28%) with median time to removal 55 days (range, 10-370); 21/22 (96%) had expandable lung documented. Six IPCs were removed for pleural infection (median 61.5 days; range, 35-92); two were removed for catheter malfunction (median 62.5 days; range, 30-95). Pleural space infection occurred in 8 (10%); five also had catheter-site cellulitis. Six of eight infected IPCs were removed and converted to chest tubes; two were managed without removal. Two patients (2.5%) died from catheter-related sepsis. Renal failure occurred in 2, and severe electrolyte imbalance in 1. Among bridge-to-transplant patients (n = 21), seven experienced IPC-related complications; IPC-related sepsis prevented transplant in one patient due to death. Median survival from HH diagnosis (n = 73 with available dates) was 485 days (95% CI, 325-722), decreasing to 368 days (95% CI, 243-613) when excluding transplant recipients. In Cox models for time from IPC insertion to death, age (HR 1.051; P < .001), WBC count (HR 1.022; P = .06), and INR (HR 0.63; P = .24) were identified in univariate screening; in multivariate analysis, only age remained significant (HR 1.047; P = .01)."
