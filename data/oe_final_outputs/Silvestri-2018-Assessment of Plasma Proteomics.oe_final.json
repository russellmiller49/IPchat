      "abstract": "Background: Lung nodules are a diagnostic challenge, with an estimated yearly incidence of 1.6 million in the United States. This study evaluated the accuracy of an integrated proteomic classifier in identifying benign nodules in patients with a pretest probability of cancer (pCA) ≤ 50%. Methods: A prospective, multicenter observational trial of 685 patients with 8- to 30-mm lung nodules was conducted. Multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry measured the relative abundance of two plasma proteins, LG3BP and C163A. Results were integrated with a clinical risk prediction model to identify likely benign nodules. Sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated, and potential changes in invasive testing were estimated if classifier results had been used. Results: In a subgroup of 178 patients with clinician-assessed pCA ≤ 50%, the prevalence of lung cancer was 16%. The integrated classifier demonstrated a sensitivity of 97% (CI, 82-100), specificity of 44% (CI, 36-52), and NPV of 98% (CI, 92-100) in distinguishing benign from malignant nodules, and performed better than PET, validated risk models, and physician estimates (P ≤ .001). If used to direct care, 40% fewer procedures would be performed on benign nodules, with 3% of malignant nodules misclassified. Conclusions: In patients with lung nodules and pCA ≤ 50%, the integrated classifier accurately identifies benign nodules and could reduce invasive procedures by directing benign nodules to surveillance.",
      "methods": "Design: Prospective, multicenter, observational diagnostic accuracy study with retrospective evaluation of classifier performance. Thirty-three sites (31 US, 2 Canada) enrolled adults ≥ 40 years with 8- to 30-mm pulmonary nodules presenting within 60 days of a baseline CT scan to a pulmonologist and/or thoracic surgeon. Exclusions included prior biopsy of the index nodule, prior CT/PET identifying the nodule, current/previous cancer within 2 years (except nonmelanoma skin cancer), or receipt of blood products within 30 days. Physicians estimated pretest probability of cancer (pCA) at enrollment. Plasma proteins LG3BP and C163A were quantified by multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry and integrated with five clinical risk factors (age, smoking status, nodule diameter, edge characteristics, and location) to produce a posttest probability of benignity using a predefined threshold (validated from discovery). Outcomes included AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and NPV. Nodules were deemed benign by pathologic diagnosis, radiographic resolution, or no growth over 1 year; malignancy required histopathology. Blinding: Physicians, subjects, lab, and statistical personnel were blinded; test results did not influence care. Statistical analysis used MATLAB and MedCalc. Group comparisons used chi-square/ANOVA; comparisons of predictors used McNemar test at fixed sensitivity or specificity. Significance threshold P ≤ 0.05.",
      "results": "Of 685 enrolled, 392 were eligible for analysis after exclusions (protocol deviations, missing data, inadequate samples). Analyses focused on a subgroup with pCA ≤ 50% (n = 178; cancer prevalence 16% with 29 malignant, 149 benign). Malignant nodules were larger than benign (16.5 mm vs 13.5 mm; P < .01). In this intended-use subgroup, the integrated classifier achieved sensitivity 97% (CI, 82-100), specificity 44% (CI, 36-52), NPV 98% (CI, 92-100), and AUC 0.76, outperforming physician pCA (AUC 0.69), VA (0.60), Mayo (0.69), and PET (0.58). Using the McNemar test at fixed sensitivity 90%, the classifier performed significantly better than these comparators (P ≤ .001; PET comparison in n = 75 with PET). Confusion matrix at the predefined threshold: 66 classified as 'likely benign' (65 benign, 1 malignant) and 112 as 'not likely benign' (84 benign, 28 malignant). If classifier results had directed care, 40% fewer procedures would be performed on benign nodules, with 3% of malignant nodules misclassified. Among immediate post-detection invasive procedures, 35/58 benign vs 23/58 malignant; 14/35 (40%) benign would have been flagged 'likely benign' and 1/23 (4%) malignant incorrectly flagged 'likely benign'."
