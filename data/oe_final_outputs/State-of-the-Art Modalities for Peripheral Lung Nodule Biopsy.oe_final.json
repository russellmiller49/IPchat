      "abstract": "Narrative review of contemporary modalities for obtaining tissue diagnosis from peripheral pulmonary nodules (PPN). The article summarizes conventional bronchoscopy limitations; image-guided bronchoscopic tools such as radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (RP-EBUS), virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN), and electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB); adjunctive technologies like confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE); and percutaneous approaches. It reports diagnostic yields from meta-analyses and trials (e.g., RP-EBUS ~70%, VBN ~72-74%) and discusses safety profiles, including higher complication rates with transthoracic needle aspiration (TTNA).",
      "methods": "Narrative, non-systematic review synthesizing published studies, meta-analyses, and selected clinical trials on peripheral lung nodule biopsy technologies. No predefined protocol, randomization, or statistical meta-analysis conducted by the authors of this review.",
      "results": "Key quantitative summaries include: conventional bronchoscopy diagnostic yield for PPN 43-65% overall, lower (14-31%) for small (<20 mm) nodules; RP-EBUS overall diagnostic yield about 69-73%, with higher yield when a guide sheath is used (84% vs 48%) and when the probe is within the lesion (84% vs 48%); a systematic review across 57 studies and 7872 lesions reported RP-EBUS diagnostic yield 70.6%; pooled VBN yield ~72-74% (lower for lesions ≤20 mm ~67%); one trial showed improved yield with VBN+RP-EBUS for lesions ≤30 mm (80% vs 67%), while another showed no significant improvement with VBN-assisted ultrathin bronchoscopy (67% vs 60%); BTPNA in a 12-patient human trial created a transparenchymal track in 10 patients with 100% diagnostic yield in those 10. TTNA sensitivity up to 90% for malignancy but with complications up to 24% in some studies."
