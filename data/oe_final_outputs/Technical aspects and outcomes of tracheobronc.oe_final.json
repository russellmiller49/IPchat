      "abstract": "Background: Tracheobronchomalacia is an underrecognized cause of dyspnea, recurrent respiratory infections, and cough. Surgical stabilization with posterior membranous tracheobronchoplasty has been shown to be effective in selected patients with severe disease. This study examines the technical details and complications of this operation. Methods: A prospectively maintained database of tracheobronchomalacia patients was queried retrospectively to review all consecutive tracheobronchoplasties performed from October 2002 to June 2009. Posterior splinting was performed with polypropylene mesh. Patient demographics, surgical outcomes, and operative data were reviewed. Results: Sixty-three patients underwent surgical correction of tracheal and bilateral bronchial malacia. Twenty-three had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 18 had asthma, 5 had Mounier-Kuhn syndrome, and 4 had interstitial lung disease. Operative time was 373 ± 93 minutes. Median length of stay was 8 days (range, 4-92), with 3 days (range, 0-91) in intensive care. Seventy-five percent of patients were discharged home (28% with visiting nurse follow-up), and 25% went to rehabilitation. Two patients (3.2%) died postoperatively—one of worsening usual interstitial pneumonia, and the other of massive pulmonary embolism. Complications included new respiratory infection in 14 patients, pulmonary embolism in 2, and atrial fibrillation in 6. Six patients required reintubation, and 9 received a postoperative tracheotomy; 47 patients required postoperative aspiration bronchoscopy. Conclusions: In experienced hands, tracheobronchoplasty can be performed with a very low mortality rate and an acceptable perioperative complications rate in patients with significant pulmonary comorbidity. Intervention for postoperative respiratory morbidity is often necessary.",
      "methods": "Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained single-center database of adults evaluated for severe tracheobronchomalacia (TBM) from October 2002 through June 2009. Severe TBM was defined as complete or near-complete collapse of the trachea and bilateral bronchi on functional bronchoscopy and dynamic computed tomography. Patients typically underwent a 2-week silicone airway stent trial; those reporting marked symptomatic improvement were considered for definitive surgery. Surgical tracheobronchoplasty (TBP) entailed posterior membranous wall splinting from thoracic inlet to distal left mainstem bronchus and bronchus intermedius using knitted polypropylene mesh secured with partial-thickness polypropylene sutures. Completion bronchoscopy confirmed airway patency and stabilization. Pre- and 3-month postoperative assessments included pulmonary function tests, 6-minute walk test, Karnofsky Performance Scale, American Thoracic Society Dyspnea Score, Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Indices, and St. George Respiratory Questionnaire. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for paired comparisons with Bonferroni correction (significance threshold p<0.01).",
      "results": "Of 218 referrals, 180 had severe TBM; 161 underwent stent trial, and 99 reported marked symptomatic improvement. Sixty-three underwent TBP (44% women; mean age 59 years). Comorbidities included COPD 37%, asthma 29%, Mounier-Kuhn 8%, interstitial lung disease 6%, GERD 48%. Mean operative time 373 ± 93 minutes. Median hospital stay 8 days (range 4-92), ICU 3 days (range 0-91). Complications occurred in 38%: new postoperative respiratory infection 22% (14/63), atrial arrhythmia 10% (6/63), acute renal failure 6% (4/63), ICU readmission 5% (3/63), UTI 3% (2/63), pulmonary embolism 3% (2/63), myocardial infarction/cardiomyopathy 2% (1/63), wound infection 2% (1/63). Reintubation 10% (6/63). Tracheotomy 14% (9/63). Two deaths (3.2%) occurred early in the series. Postoperative bronchoscopy was performed in 75% (median 2, range 1-32). At 3 months, paired assessments showed: FEV1 (n=37) 1.62 ± 0.76 L pre vs 1.66 ± 0.67 L post, p=0.29; Karnofsky (n=33) 62 ± 12 vs 76 ± 14, p<0.001; ATS Dyspnea Score (n=34) 3.06 ± 0.9 vs 1.65 ± 1.01, p<0.001; SGRQ (n=35) 74 ± 13 vs 46 ± 21, p<0.001; 6MWD feet (n=33) 987 ± 502 vs 1187 ± 347, p<0.005. Baseline Dyspnea Index (n=31) 3.32 ± 1.83; Transition Dyspnea Index (n=31) post 3.55 ± 5.25."
