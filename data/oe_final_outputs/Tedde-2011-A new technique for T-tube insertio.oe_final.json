      "abstract": "A silicone T tube is widely used for the management of airway problems. Montgomery described the way in which it is usually inserted, but this conventional insertion technique can fail in cases of subglottic stenosis due to the softness of the T tube, which kinks when forced against resistance. An adjunct to the traditional technique of Montgomery may help to insert a T tube in such patients.",
      "methods": "Bronchoscopy for evaluation under topical anaesthesia and sedation, followed by general anaesthesia (usually spontaneous ventilation). Airway dilatation with suspension laryngoscopy or rigid bronchoscopy, then initiation of Montgomery T-tube insertion. When difficulty placing the proximal end occurred, the adjunct technique was used: a 10-F nasogastric tube (NT) was folded and inserted via the mouth and retrieved through the tracheostoma; passed through the proximal end of the T tube and exteriorised in the extraluminal limb. The folded NT was introduced through the distal perforation of a Foley catheter to create a loop around the T tube, then tractioned back to attach firmly to the Foley. The distal end of the T tube was grasped and inserted classically into the trachea. The NT/Foley set was stretched to aid entry of the proximal end into the trachea. Under bronchoscopic direct vision, the Foley cuff was insufflated as needed until the proximal end within the stenotic area was fully unfolded and adjusted.",
      "results": "Using this technique in the last six ambulatory patients with conventional Montgomery technique failure, the authors achieved optimal location of the proximal end without requiring other auxiliary techniques (trachea re-dilatation, suspension laryngoscopy, or rigid bronchoscopy)."
