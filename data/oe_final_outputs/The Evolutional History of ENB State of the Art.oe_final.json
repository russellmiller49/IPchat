      "abstract": "Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) has evolved from early electromagnetic tracking concepts to widely used clinical systems that assist with diagnosis and treatment planning for pulmonary lesions. This review outlines historical development, device systems, clinical performance (diagnostic yield), safety (notably pneumothorax), and expanding applications including fiducial placement, pleural dye marking, molecular tissue acquisition, lymph node sampling, and percutaneous interventions.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of the evolution, technology, and clinical evidence related to ENB systems, drawing on preclinical and clinical studies, large registries, and device capabilities as reported in the literature.",
      "results": "Early human feasibility studies demonstrated successful navigation and biopsy with acceptable safety. Across >30 clinical studies, diagnostic yield for ENB-assisted sampling ranged from 33% to 97%, with most studies between 67% and 84%. Pooled pneumothorax rates are typically around 3%, and a 1,000-patient prospective multicenter study reported 4.9% ENB-related pneumothorax and 3.2% requiring chest tube or hospitalization. ENB has been successfully used for fiducial placement, pleural dye marking, molecular profiling, and mediastinal lymph node sampling, and can be integrated perioperatively."
