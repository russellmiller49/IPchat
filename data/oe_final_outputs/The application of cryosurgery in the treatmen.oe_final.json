      "abstract": "Lung cancer is the commonest cause of cancer death, with a very poor survival rate. By the time of diagnosis, most cases are at an advanced stage and about 30% present with symptoms caused by central endobronchial obstruction. Endobronchial cryosurgery is an effective technique to relieve tracheobronchial obstruction caused by lung cancer. Using a nitrous oxide-cooled cryoprobe inserted through a bronchoscope, obstruction is removed to reopen the airway. In this prospective study, 476 consecutive patients (mean age 68.3 years; male:female ratio 1.9:1) with obstructive tracheobronchial tumours underwent a mean of 2.4 cryosurgical treatments. TNM staging: stage II 6.7%, IIIa 21.0%, IIIb 23.9%, IV 48.4%. Symptom improvement among symptomatic patients was observed for haemoptysis 76.4%, cough 69.0%, dyspnoea 59.2%, and chest pain 42.6%. Mean respiratory function improved: FEV1 from 1.38 to 1.47 L (p ≤ 0.0001) and FVC from 1.91 to 2.04 L (p ≤ 0.0001). Mean performance status improved (Karnofsky 59.6 to 75.2; WHO 3.04 to 2.20). Complication rate was 3.5% of treatments. Kaplan-Meier median survival was 8.2 months; 1- and 2-year survival were 38.4% and 15.9%, respectively. Endobronchial cryosurgery provides a safe and effective palliative method for otherwise inoperable lung cancer.",
      "methods": "Prospective single-institution series (January 1995-June 2002) of 476 inoperable patients with obstructive malignant endobronchial tumours. All patients had confirmed pathology (97.2% histology, 2.8% sputum cytology). Data collected included symptoms (dyspnoea, cough, haemoptysis, chest pain, dysphagia, anorexia, stridor, depression), respiratory function tests (FEV1, FVC), and performance status (WHO and Karnofsky). Diagnostics included chest X-ray and bronchoscopy in all, CT in 38%, mediastinoscopy in 14%. Endobronchial cryosurgery under short-acting IV general anaesthesia used rigid (9.2 mm) or flexible bronchoscope (2.4 mm). A nitrous oxide Joule-Thomson cryoprobe (5 mm or 2.2 mm) was applied to tumour, freezing for 3 minutes per application with 1-2 freeze-thaw cycles depending on depth; multiple applications were performed as needed. Necrotic tumour was removed with rigid biopsy forceps when present. Temperatures at the probe tip were around -70°C; local tissue temperature measurements in prior work showed mean minimum -30°C (SD 5.6) approximately 2 mm from the tip. Bleeding was controlled with topical epinephrine 1:1000. Repeat treatment was typically done at 2 weeks; procedures were repeated upon symptom recurrence.",
      "results": "Among 476 treated patients (mean age 68.3 years, range 22-88; median 70.0; male:female 1.9:1), histologies included squamous cell 68.3%, adenocarcinoma 15.2%, large cell 2.6%, unclassified NSCLC 5.2%, and small cell 8.7%. NSCLC staging at treatment: II 6.7%, IIIa 21.0%, IIIb 23.9%, IV 48.4%. Prior therapy: radiotherapy 39%, chemotherapy 9%. All patients were symptomatic pre-cryosurgery. Mean FEV1 increased from 1.38 to 1.47 L (p ≤ 0.0001); mean FVC from 1.91 to 2.04 L (p ≤ 0.0001). Mean performance status improved (Karnofsky 59.6 to 75.2; WHO 3.04 to 2.20). Proportions of symptomatic patients improving post-cryosurgery: cough 69.0%, dyspnoea 59.2%, haemoptysis 76.4%, chest pain 42.6%, dysphagia 28.6%, anorexia 47.8%, stridor 37.5%, depression 53.9%. Complications per treatment: bleeding 0.7%, pneumothorax 0.1%, respiratory distress 0.9%, anaesthetic-related 0.2%, cardiac 1.6%; overall 3.5% of treatments. Kaplan-Meier median survival was 8.2 months; 1-year survival 38.4%; 2-year survival 15.9%. Median survival by stage (months; 95% CI): II 15.1 (9.1-22.7), IIIa 8.5 (5.6-11.7), IIIb 9.0 (6.4-11.4), IV 6.6 (5.4-7.7)."
