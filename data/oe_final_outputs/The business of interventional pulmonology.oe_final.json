      "abstract": "This narrative review outlines how interventional pulmonology services are financed and reimbursed in the United States and Canada. It reviews private and public insurance structures, fee-for-service versus alternative payment models (pay for performance, medical home, accountable care organizations), relative value unit (RVU)-based reimbursement, and procedural coding (CPT). The article emphasizes the need for interventional pulmonology practices to understand reimbursement systems, manage facility and indirect costs, and adapt to evolving policies and quality metrics.",
      "methods": "Narrative review and expert perspective based on contemporary reimbursement policies, coding standards, and health system payment models. No primary data collection or inferential statistical analyses were performed.",
      "results": "Key topics include: (1) distinctions between private insurance, HMOs, PPOs, Medicare (Parts A-D), and state-specific Medicaid programs; (2) implications of fee-for-service reimbursement and alternatives such as pay-for-performance, medical homes, and ACOs; (3) RVU components (physician work, practice expense, malpractice) and site-of-service differences in reimbursement; (4) importance of facility fees and indirect costs in procedural program viability; and (5) CPT code categories (I-III) and their use in billing for interventional pulmonology procedures."
