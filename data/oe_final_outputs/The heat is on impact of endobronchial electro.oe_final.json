      "abstract": "Study objectives: Advances in bronchoscopic electrosurgery have allowed its application in the outpatient setting in patients who otherwise would have required Nd-YAG laser photoresection (LPR) in the operating room. We intended to evaluate the impact of endobronchial electrosurgery (EBES) on the need for Nd-YAG LPR on patients with symptomatic airway lesions. Design: Prospective observational case series. Participants: One hundred eighteen evaluations for LPR were performed. Forty-seven evaluations (40%) were considered to be amendable to EBES and were treated during the initial bronchoscopy. The remaining patients underwent LPR. Setting: Outpatient bronchoscopy suite at the Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH. Results: Of the 47 procedures, 42 (89%) were successful in alleviating the obstruction, thus eliminating the need for LPR. No major complications were encountered. Conclusion: EBES can be performed safely in the outpatient setting and is an effective procedure in treating select endobronchial lesions. EBES eliminated the need for LPR in 36% of such procedures with a potential for significant time and cost savings.",
      "methods": "Prospective evaluation of patients referred for Nd-YAG laser photoresection (LPR) since August 1997. During the study period, 118 evaluations for LPR were performed. If during initial flexible bronchoscopy an endobronchial lesion amenable to EBES was encountered, EBES was attempted in the outpatient bronchoscopy suite under conscious sedation. Eligibility for EBES required < 50% luminal obstruction, visualized size < 2 cm, limited vascularity, and estimated procedure time < 1 h. EBES was performed using a flexible bronchoscope (Olympus BF 240) and an electrosurgical unit (Olympus PSD-10) with cut, coagulate, and blend modes delivered via accessories (polypectomy snare, coagulation probe, forceps, cutting blade). Pedunculated lesions were resected with a snare; sessile lesions were ablated with a coagulation probe; concentric web-like strictures were incised with a blade followed by balloon dilation. Success was defined as relief of obstruction eliminating the need for LPR. Procedures exceeding 1 h or limited by intolerance (excessive bleeding or coughing) were considered unsuccessful. Monitoring included continuous oxygen saturation, ECG, and BP; supplemental oxygen was titrated to maintain saturation > 92%.",
      "results": "Thirty-eight patients (22 men, 16 women; age 24-85 years) underwent 47 EBES procedures treating 68 lesions. One patient required four procedures, one required three, and three patients required two for recurrent disease. Lesion etiologies included benign (papillomatosis, granulation tissue, lipoma, hamartoma, stenosis) and malignant (bronchogenic carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma, colon adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, lymphoma, carcinoid). Lesion locations included trachea (24), mainstem bronchi (27), lobar bronchi (16), and tracheostomy stoma (1). EBES was successful in 42 of 47 procedures (89%), eliminating the need for LPR. Failures occurred in lesions larger or more extensive than anticipated or with significant vascularity. Complications were few: bleeding (4), limited field of view (3), transient desaturation (1), excessive cough (1). No hospitalizations or endotracheal intubations occurred as a consequence of the procedure. Across the 118 LPR evaluations during the period, EBES eliminated LPR in 42 cases (~36%)."
