      "abstract": "Background: The optimal choice of chest tube size for the treatment of pleural infection is unknown, with only small cohort studies reported describing the efficacy and adverse events of different tube sizes. Methods: A total of 405 patients with pleural infection were prospectively enrolled into a multi-center study investigating the utility of fibrinolytic therapy. The combined frequency of death and surgery, and secondary outcomes (hospital stay, change in chest radiograph, and lung function at 3 months) were compared in patients receiving chest tubes of differing size (chi-square, t test, and logistic regression analyses as appropriate). Pain was studied in detail in 128 patients. Results: There was no significant difference in the frequency with which patients either died or required thoracic surgery in patients receiving chest tubes of varying sizes (<10F: 21/58 [36%]; 10-14F: 75/208 [36%]; 15-20F: 28/70 [40%]; >20F: 30/69 [44%]; chi-square trend 1 df = 1.21, P = .27), nor any difference in any secondary outcome. Pain scores were substantially higher in patients receiving (mainly blunt dissection-inserted) larger tubes (<10F median pain score 6 [range 4-7]; 10-14F 5 [4-6]; 15-20F 6 [5-7]; >20F 6 [6-8]; chi-square 3 df = 10.80, P = .013; chi-square trend 1 df = 6.3, P = .014). Conclusions: Smaller, guide-wire-inserted chest tubes cause substantially less pain than blunt-dissection-inserted larger tubes, without any impairment in clinical outcome in the treatment of pleural infection. These results suggest that smaller size tubes may be the initial treatment of choice for pleural infection, and randomized studies are now required. Trial registration: ISRCTN39138989.",
      "methods": "This is a predefined observational analysis within the MIST1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of intrapleural streptokinase vs placebo in pleural infection. Four hundred fifty-four patients were recruited from 52 UK centers; detailed chest tube size data were available for 405 patients. Inclusion criteria were pleural fluid that was macroscopically purulent, positive on culture, positive on Gram stain, or pH < 7.2 in a patient with clinical evidence of infection. Chest tube size and insertion technique (guide-wire [Seldinger] vs blunt dissection) were chosen by treating clinicians. Saline flushes were used for tubes <14F; suction of -20 cm H2O was applied to all tubes. Primary endpoint was death or need for thoracic surgery up to 12 months. Secondary endpoints included death alone, surgery alone, length of hospital stay, chest radiograph improvement, and FEV1/FVC at 3 months. Pain was assessed via questionnaire in 128 patients (insertion, in-situ, removal). Statistical methods included chi-square tests (including trend), Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis, Kaplan-Meier/log-rank, and logistic regression adjusting for known prognostic factors (e.g., age, urea, albumin, diastolic BP, hospital-acquired infection, bacteriology class).",
      "results": "Among 405 patients with known tube size, the composite of death or thoracic surgery at 12 months did not differ by tube size (<10F 21/58 [36%]; 10-14F 75/208 [36%]; 15-20F 28/70 [40%]; >20F 30/69 [44%]; chi-square trend 1 df = 1.21, P = .27). Time-to-event curves were similar (log-rank chi-square 3 df = 1.58, P = .66). After logistic regression adjusting for known prognostic covariates, tube size was not associated with the composite endpoint (P for tube size in model = .96). Secondary outcomes showed no significant differences across tube sizes: death at 1 year (10/58 vs 46/208 vs 18/70 vs 17/69; P = .67), surgery at 1 year (11/58 vs 35/208 vs 13/70 vs 13/69; P = .97), hospital stay (means [SD] 26 [29] vs 24 [32] vs 31 [39] vs 28 [23] days; ANOVA F = 1.04, P = .37), FEV1 at 3 months (2.46 [1.0] vs 2.16 [0.79] vs 2.30 [0.88] vs 2.15 [0.90] L; ANOVA F = 1.17, P = .32), and FVC at 3 months (3.30 [1.19] vs 2.98 [0.98] vs 3.18 [1.13] vs 2.84 [1.00] L; ANOVA F = 1.42, P = .24). In subgroup analysis of patients with purulent fluid, smaller tubes were favored (12/42 [29%] vs 55/164 [34%] vs 25/58 [43%] vs 29/65 [45%]; chi-square trend 1 df = 4.3, P = .04). Nonpurulent subgroup showed a borderline trend (9/16 [56%] vs 20/44 [46%] vs 3/12 [25%] vs 1/4 [25%]; chi-square trend 1 df = 3.0, P = .08). Pain scores were higher with larger tubes and with blunt-dissection technique; overall pain Kruskal-Wallis chi-square 3 df = 10.80, P = .013; trend chi-square 1 df = 7.29, P = .008."
