      "abstract": "Background: Laser has been the main ablative modality in the airways, but a growing experience with endobronchial electrocautery suggests a comparable efficacy and safety profile. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of electrocautery as the primary heat therapy for malignant and benign airway obstruction. Methods: A retrospective review of all patients undergoing endobronchial electrocautery, alone or in combination with other airway tools, at Duke University Medical Center between April 2004 and November 2009. Data on efficacy (luminal patency, symptomatic, radiographic, or physiologic improvement) and safety (complication rate) were collected. Results: Ninety-four patients underwent 117 procedures with endobronchial electrocautery for endobronchial malignant and nonmalignant disease. Endoscopic improvement was seen in 94% of cases. Seventy-one percent of patients reported symptomatic improvement. Radiographic studies demonstrated luminal improvement in 78% of patients on chest computed tomography, improved aeration on chest computed tomography and chest x-ray in 63% and 43% of patients, respectively. The rate of major complications was 0.8%, whereas minor complications occurred in 6.8% of cases. There was no perioperative mortality. Conclusions: Endobronchial electrocautery is effective and safe when used as an ablative modality in malignant and benign airway obstruction and has a comparable profile to laser with the advantage of lower cost.",
      "methods": "Retrospective review of all patients referred to Duke University Medical Center for central airway obstruction between April 2004 and November 2009 who underwent endobronchial electrocautery. Electrocautery was performed using an ERBE surgical system with snare, knife, and monopolar probes per standardized power protocols. Data sources included procedure notes, clinic visits, pulmonary function tests, and radiologic images accessed via the electronic medical record. Primary outcomes were response to treatment (endoscopic luminal improvement ≥50%, symptomatic change, radiographic changes in airway lumen or lung aeration, spirometry improvement ≥10%) and complication rates. Rigid or flexible bronchoscopy was used. Additional modalities (balloon dilation, tissue excision, stenting) were recorded.",
      "results": "Ninety-four patients underwent 117 procedures. Most had malignant disease; common sites were trachea and mainstem bronchi. Rigid bronchoscopy was used in 62% of procedures. Electrocautery probe, knife, and snare were used in 78%, 15%, and 7%, respectively. Adjuncts included balloon dilation (25%), tissue excision (60%), and stenting (31%). Endoscopic luminal improvement (≥50%) occurred in 110/117 (94%) procedures. Postoperative symptom data were available for 93 patients: improvement in 66 (71%), worsening in 12 (13%), no change in 15 (16%). One-month mortality was 6% of patients. Radiography: chest CT pre/post available in 23 patients, with luminal improvement in 18 (78%); among those with only chest x-rays and collapse pre/post available (n=21), 9 (43%) improved. Spirometry pre/post (n=14): improvement ≥10% in FEV1 or FVC in 5 (36%), no improvement in 7 (50%), worsening in 2 (14%). Major complications: 1/117 (0.8%), due to aspiration during anesthesia induction with subsequent atrial fibrillation. Minor complications: 8/117 (6.8%), including minor bleeding (3), postprocedure bronchospasm (2), pneumonia (2), and a chipped tooth (1). No perioperative mortality."
