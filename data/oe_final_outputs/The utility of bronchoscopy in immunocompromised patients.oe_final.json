      "abstract": "Bronchoscopy is an important tool for the diagnosis of pulmonary disorders in immunocompromised patients. The addition of biopsies to bronchoalveolar lavage improves the diagnostic yield of non-infectious etiologies, although the underlying etiology of the immunocompromised state must be considered and may be influential. Certain unknowns remain, including timing of bronchoscopy and its impact on medical management and mortality. The ongoing role of non-invasive testing for infectious complications prior to bronchoscopy also remains to be defined. This review addresses the role of bronchoscopy in immunocompromised states related to underlying hematologic malignancies, prescription drug use or chemotherapy, and other disorders that predispose patients to infectious or non-infectious pulmonary diseases.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of the literature on bronchoscopy in immunocompromised patients; methods for literature identification and selection were not systematically described in the article.",
      "results": "Across immunocompromised populations (solid organ transplant, hematopoietic stem cell transplant, hematologic malignancy/neutropenia, HIV, medication- or chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, and primary immunodeficiency), bronchoscopy diagnostic yields generally range from approximately 27% to 70%. Addition of transbronchial biopsy (TBB) to bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) improves yield for non-infectious etiologies but may increase complications. Early bronchoscopy (within 24 hours) after presentation is associated with higher diagnostic yield than later procedures in HSCT cohorts. In a large multinational observational ICU cohort (n=1,611) of immunocompromised patients with acute respiratory failure, bronchoscopy (n=618) achieved an adjusted diagnostic yield of 27% (165/618) and therapeutic yield of 38% (236/618), but was associated with worsening respiratory status in 11% (69/618), higher ICU mortality (40% vs. 28%, p<0.0001) and hospital mortality (49% vs. 41%, p=0.003) compared with non-invasive testing. Management changes after bronchoscopy vary widely (approximately 20%-70%) across studies and settings. In HIV, BAL yields for bacterial infection can be as high as 96% (higher if performed before antibiotics), and PJP detection on BAL is 96%-98% without additional benefit from TBB. Complications of bronchoscopy may occur in up to 50% of patients in some series."
