      "abstract": "Background: There is significant variation between physicians in how they perform therapeutic bronchoscopy, with limited data on whether these differences impact effectiveness. Methods: Multicenter registry study (AQuIRE) of patients undergoing therapeutic bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction. Primary outcome was technical success, defined as reopening the airway lumen to >50% of normal; secondary outcomes were dyspnea (Borg score) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL; SF-6D). Results: Fifteen centers performed 1,115 procedures on 947 patients. Technical success was achieved in 93% of procedures; center success rates ranged 90%-98% (P = .02). Endobronchial obstruction and stent placement were associated with success; ASA score >3, renal failure, primary lung cancer, left mainstem disease, and tracheoesophageal fistula were associated with failure. Clinically significant improvements in dyspnea occurred in 90/187 (48%), and in HRQOL in 76/183 (42%). Greater baseline dyspnea was associated with greater improvements; smoking, multiple cancers, and lobar obstruction were associated with smaller improvements. Conclusions: Technical success rates were high overall, with highest success associated with stent placement and endobronchial obstruction. Therapeutic bronchoscopy should not be withheld based solely on risk assessment, as patients with most dyspnea and lowest functional status benefited most.",
      "methods": "Patients undergoing therapeutic flexible or rigid bronchoscopy for malignant central airway obstruction (occlusion ≥50% of trachea, mainstem bronchi, bronchus intermedius, or a lobar bronchus) were prospectively entered into the AQuIRE registry (January 2009-February 2013). Clinical decisions and intervention modalities were at the bronchoscopist’s discretion. Primary outcome was technical success, bronchoscopically defined as reopening the airway lumen to >50% of normal and connecting to viable distal lung; discovery of distal occlusion after proximal reopening was considered failure. A subset of centers prospectively collected preprocedure and 30-day postprocedure dyspnea (Borg score) and HRQOL (SF-6D). Change in dyspnea was post - pre (ΔBorg); clinically significant improvement defined as ΔBorg ≤ -1 (MCID). Change in utility was post - pre (Δutility); clinically significant improvement defined as Δutility ≥ 0.033 (MCID). Statistical analysis used chi-square/Fisher exact/Wilcoxon tests for binary outcomes and F-test/t-test/ANCOVA for continuous outcomes; Wilcoxon signed-rank for paired changes. Variables with P < .20 in univariate analyses were candidates for multivariable models (backward selection, retain P < .05). Baseline Borg was included in ΔBorg models to control for regression to the mean. Hierarchical logistic regression evaluated center-level variation.",
      "results": "Fifteen centers (26 physicians) enrolled 947 patients who underwent 1,115 procedures. Technical success was achieved in 1,039/1,115 procedures (93%). Among eight higher-volume centers (≥25 cases; n = 1,052), success rates ranged 90%-98% (P = .02); after accounting for covariates, between-center variance was negligible and no relationship with center volume was found. On multivariable analysis, endobronchial obstruction and stent placement were associated with higher technical success; ASA score >3, renal failure, primary lung cancer, left mainstem disease, and tracheoesophageal fistula were associated with lower success. Dyspnea subset (n = 187) showed decreased dyspnea post-intervention (mean ΔBorg -0.9 ± 2.2; Wilcoxon signed-rank P < .0001). Higher baseline Borg was associated with greater improvement (each 1-unit higher baseline associated with 0.63-unit greater decrease in ΔBorg; P < .0001). Smokers, patients with another primary solid tumor, and those with lobar obstruction had smaller improvements. In responder analysis, 90/187 (48%) had a clinically significant improvement in dyspnea, 81/187 (43%) no change, and 16/187 (9%) worsened. HRQOL subset (n = 183) had 76/183 (42%) with clinically significant utility improvement; greater baseline dyspnea associated with greater utility improvement, lobar obstruction with smaller improvements. Complications are reported separately."
