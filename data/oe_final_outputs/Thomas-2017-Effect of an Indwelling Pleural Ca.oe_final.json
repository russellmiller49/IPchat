      "abstract": "Importance: Indwelling pleural catheter and talc pleurodesis are established treatments for malignant pleural effusions among patients with poor prognosis. Objective: To determine whether indwelling pleural catheters are more effective than talc pleurodesis in reducing total hospitalization days in the remaining lifespan of patients with malignant pleural effusion. Design, Setting, and Participants: Open-label, randomized clinical trial at 9 centers in Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Hong Kong. Enrollment occurred July 2012 to October 2014 with 12-month follow-up (study end date October 16, 2015). Adults with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion who had not undergone indwelling pleural catheter or pleurodesis were included (n=146). Interventions: Randomization (1:1) to indwelling pleural catheter (IPC) or talc pleurodesis, with minimization by malignancy (mesothelioma vs others) and trapped lung (yes vs no), and stratification by region (Australia/New Zealand vs Asia). Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary endpoint was total number of days spent in hospital from procedure to death or to 12 months. Secondary outcomes included effusion-related hospitalization days, further pleural interventions, breathlessness (VAS), quality of life (EQ-5D and VAS), survival, and adverse events. Results: Of 146 randomized (median age 70.5 years; 56.2% male), 2 withdrew prior to treatment and were excluded, leaving 144 in the intention-to-treat analyses (IPC 73; talc 71). IPC patients had fewer total hospitalization days than pleurodesis patients (median 10 [IQR 3-17] vs 12 [IQR 7-21]; Hodges-Lehmann difference 2.92 days; 95% CI 0.43-5.84; P=.03), driven mainly by fewer effusion-related days (median 1 [IQR 1-3] vs 4 [IQR 3-6]; HL 2.06 days; 95% CI 1.53-2.58; P<.001). Fewer IPC patients required further ipsilateral invasive pleural procedures (3/73 [4%] vs 16/71 [22%]; absolute difference 0.18; 95% CI 0.08-0.29; P=.001). Breathlessness and quality-of-life improvements did not differ significantly. Adverse events occurred in both groups: 30 events in 22 IPC patients and 23 events in 13 pleurodesis patients. Conclusions and Relevance: In malignant pleural effusion, IPC vs talc pleurodesis resulted in fewer hospitalization days from treatment to death, with uncertain clinical importance of the magnitude. Trial Registration: ACTRN12611000567921.",
      "methods": "Multicenter, randomized, open-label trial at 9 centers (Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong). Adults with symptomatic malignant pleural effusion with histocytological confirmation of pleural malignancy or recurrent exudative pleural effusions with no alternative cause in the setting of histocytologically proven extra-pleural cancer were eligible. Exclusions included age <18 years, effusion <2 cm on imaging, expected survival <3 months, chylothorax, prior ipsilateral lobectomy/pneumonectomy, prior pleurodesis, pleural infection, hypercapnic ventilatory failure, leukocytes <1000/μL, pregnancy/lactation, irreversible bleeding diathesis, visual impairment. Randomization 1:1 to IPC or talc slurry pleurodesis with allocation concealment via real-time computerized minimization (malignancy type; trapped lung) and stratification by region. IPCs were inserted using modified Seldinger technique with tunneling, with ambulatory drainage guided by symptoms; removal when clinically indicated. Talc pleurodesis used tube thoracostomy (12-18F) with talc slurry instillation per local routine. Usual oncologic and palliative care per treating clinicians. Primary outcome: total hospital days from intervention to death or 12 months, counting any admission involving at least 1 day (midnight crossing), excluding day-case procedures. Secondary outcomes: effusion-related hospitalizations (days and episodes), need for further pleural drainage procedures, VAS breathlessness, EQ-5D and VAS QoL, survival, adverse and serious adverse events. Statistical analysis: Intention-to-treat (excluding 2 who withdrew prior to treatment) and per-protocol analyses. Primary endpoint analyzed with Mann-Whitney U and Hodges-Lehmann estimate of location shift (95% CI); supportive negative binomial model adjusted for length of follow-up, minimization variables, and random center effect. Secondary outcomes analyzed similarly; further pleural interventions by Fisher exact test; survival by log-rank and Cox models; VAS/EQ-5D by linear mixed effects models with adjustments; multiple imputation sensitivity analyses for missing PROs.",
      "results": "Of 226 screened, 146 randomized (IPC 74, talc 72). One in each group withdrew prior to receiving randomized treatment; thus 144 included in intention-to-treat (IPC 73; talc 71) and 134 in per-protocol (IPC 71; talc 63). Baseline characteristics were balanced. Median total all-cause hospital days: IPC 10 (IQR 3-17) vs talc 12 (IQR 7-21); Hodges-Lehmann difference 2.92 days (95% CI 0.43-5.84); P=.03. Means (SD): IPC 12.7 (13.4) vs talc 16.3 (15.2). Effusion-related hospital days: IPC 1 (IQR 1-3) vs talc 4 (IQR 3-6); HL 2.06 (95% CI 1.53-2.58); P<.001. Fewer ipsilateral invasive pleural procedures were required in IPC: 3/73 (4%) vs 16/71 (22%); absolute risk difference 0.18 (95% CI 0.08-0.29); P=.001. No significant between-group differences in breathlessness or QoL improvements. Adverse events: 30 events in 22 IPC patients vs 23 events in 13 talc patients."
