Despite increasing recognition, uncertainty remains regarding identification, causes, and treatment. This comprehensive review covers historical aspects, classification, associated conditions, histopathology, natural history, diagnostic modalities, and current treatments, including airway stenting and surgical intervention.",
      "methods": "Exhaustive literature review from the late 1800s to the time of publication using multiple medical literature search engines and Harvard Medical School resources, including non-English references. Narrative synthesis; no predefined protocol or quantitative meta-analysis reported.",
      "results": "Key findings summarized: classification into congenital (primary) and acquired (secondary) forms; associations with genetic syndromes and tracheoesophageal anomalies; histopathologic features include reduced cartilage-to-muscle ratio and widened posterior membranous wall. Reported epidemiology includes an estimated congenital TM incidence of 1 per 1445 infants; evidence of TM in 15.4% of infants in a series of 664 diagnostic bronchoscopies; TM present in up to 30% of children aged â‰¤3 years undergoing bronchoscopy for respiratory distress; in a cohort of 50 infants with TM, 48% were primary and 52% secondary, with 96% of secondary cases in premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Severe TM can have mortality rates as high as 80%. Diagnostic approaches discussed include bronchoscopy and imaging; management options include conservative care (e.g., CPAP), addressing underlying causes, airway stents, and surgical interventions."
