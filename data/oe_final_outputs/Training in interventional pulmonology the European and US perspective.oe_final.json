      "abstract": "As the breadth of interventional pulmonology continues to expand, training in this discipline gains further importance. Interventional pulmonology training in the USA and Europe has common roots and similar concepts; however, there are variations in its delivery. We discuss the similarities, differences, challenges and goals of interventional pulmonology training in both continents. Collaboration and exchange of experiences between the USA and Europe are fundamental to entering the new era of competency/mastery training to implement a multidimensional approach to procedure-related education.",
      "methods": "Narrative review and perspective describing structures, curricula, certification pathways, and competency frameworks for interventional pulmonology training in the USA and Europe. Content synthesizes society guidance, certification program structures, and illustrative procedural requirement tables.",
      "results": "US training emphasizes a standardized, comprehensive fellowship model with a defined application process and society-endorsed accreditation guidelines. European training emphasizes procedure-specific certification and country-level programs, including ERS certifications and national master's programs, with blended learning, simulation, supervised practice, and logbook-based competency tracking. The article summarizes recommended procedural volumes, staged competency development using simulation and supervised practice, and the shift toward competency-based medical education and deliberate practice."
