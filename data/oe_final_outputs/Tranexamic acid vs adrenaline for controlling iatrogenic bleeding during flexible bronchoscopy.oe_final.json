      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most commonly used topical hemostatic agents during flexible bronchoscopy (FB) are cold saline and adrenaline. Data on use of other agents such as tranexamic acid (TXA) for this purpose are limited. RESEARCH QUESTION: Is TXA effective and safe in controlling iatrogenic bleeding during FB compared with adrenaline? STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a cluster-randomized, double-blind, single-center trial in a tertiary teaching hospital. Patients were randomized in weekly clusters to receive up to three applications of TXA (100 mg, 2 mL) or adrenaline (0.2 mg, 2 mL, 1:10000) after hemostasis failure after three applications of cold saline (4°C, 5 mL). Crossover was allowed (for up to three further applications) before proceeding with other interventions. Bleeding severity was graded by the bronchoscopist using a visual analog scale (VAS; 1 = very mild, 10 = severe). RESULTS: A total of 2,033 FBs were performed and 130 patients were randomized successfully to adrenaline (n = 65) or TXA (n = 65), whereas 12 patients had to be excluded for protocol violations (two patients from the adrenaline arm and 10 patients from TXA arm). Bleeding was stopped in 83.1% of patients (54/65) in both groups (P = 1). The severity of bleeding and number of applications needed for bleeding control were similar in both groups (adrenaline: mean VAS score, 4.9 ± 1.3 [n = 1.8 ± 0.8]; TXA: mean VAS score, 5.3 ± 1.4 [n = 1.8 ± 0.8]). Both adrenaline and TXA were more successful in controlling moderate bleeding (86.7% and 88.7%, respectively) than severe bleeding (40% and 58.3%, respectively; P = .008 and P = .012, respectively) and required more applications for severe bleeding (3.0 ± 0 and 2.4 ± 0.5, respectively) than moderate bleeding (1.7 ± 0.8 and 1.7 ± 0.8, respectively) control (P = .006 and P = .002, respectively). We observed no drug-related adverse events in either group. INTERPRETATION: We found no significant difference between adrenaline and TXA for controlling noncatastrophic iatrogenic endobronchial bleeding after cold saline failure, adding to the body of evidence that TXA can be used safely and effectively during FB.",
      "methods": "Pragmatic, cluster-randomized, double-blind, single-center trial at a tertiary teaching hospital (February 22, 2021-February 4, 2022). All patients undergoing diagnostic flexible bronchoscopy (including mediastinal staging with convex probe EBUS and peripheral bronchoscopy with radial probe EBUS) were screened and consented. Standard initial hemostasis was three applications of 5 mL cold (4°C) saline. Patients with persistent bleeding were randomized by weekly clusters to receive up to three applications of TXA (2 mL of 50 mg/mL; 100 mg per application) or adrenaline (2 mL of 1:10,000; 0.2 mg per application), with at least 60 s between applications. If bleeding persisted, crossover to the other agent was allowed (up to three further applications 60 s apart) before escalation to other measures. Drug syringes were identical and labeled 1 or 2 per weekly allocation. Bronchoscopists, nurses, patients, and outcome assessors were blinded; allocation was known only to a supervising doctor and nurse not involved in care. The primary outcome was the proportion with successfully controlled bleeding (visual confirmation of clot formation). Secondary outcomes included mean number of applications to achieve hemostasis, recurrent bleeding episodes, success by severity (VAS 1-10), indications, sampling methods, and adverse events. Statistics used chi-square, t tests, and Mann-Whitney U tests; two-sided P < 0.05 significant.",
      "results": "Among 2,033 FBs, 575 bleeding episodes occurred (mean VAS 3.6 ± 1.3). Bleeding stopped with cold saline in 432 (75.1%). One patient declined further treatment. Of 142 randomized (TXA 75; adrenaline 67), 12 were excluded for protocol violations/unmasking, yielding 130 analyzed (65 per arm). Primary outcome: hemostasis success 54/65 (83.1%) in both arms (P = 1). Mean VAS and number of applications to control bleeding were similar (adrenaline VAS 4.9 ± 1.3; TXA VAS 5.3 ± 1.4; both 1.8 ± 0.8 applications). More severe bleeding episodes occurred in TXA (12/65, 18.5%) vs adrenaline (5/65, 7.7%; P = 0.069). Success by severity showed higher success in moderate vs severe bleeding for both agents; required applications were higher for severe vs moderate. No drug-related adverse events were observed. Across the study period (2,033 FBs), nine SAEs occurred; in randomized patients, adrenaline arm had three SAEs (acute respiratory failure, transient ischemic attack, recurrent bleeding after early termination), and TXA arm had two SAEs (hospitalization for recurrent bleeding) but those two were excluded per protocol."
