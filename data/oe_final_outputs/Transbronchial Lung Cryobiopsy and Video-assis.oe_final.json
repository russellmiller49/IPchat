      "abstract": "Rationale: Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy is increasingly being used for the assessment of diffuse parenchymal lung diseases. Several studies have shown larger biopsy samples and higher yields compared with conventional transbronchial biopsies. However, the higher risk of bleeding and other complications has raised concerns for widespread use of this modality. Objectives: To study the diagnostic accuracy and safety profile of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and compare with video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) by reviewing available evidence from the literature. Methods: Medline and PubMed were searched from inception until December 2016. Data on diagnostic performance were abstracted by constructing two-by-two contingency tables for each study. Data on a priori selected safety outcomes were collected. Risk of bias was assessed with the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies tool. Random effects meta-analyses were performed to obtain summary estimates of the diagnostic accuracy. Results: The pooled diagnostic yield, pooled sensitivity, and pooled specificity of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy were 83.7% (76.9-88.8%), 87% (85-89%), and 57% (40-73%), respectively. The pooled diagnostic yield, pooled sensitivity, and pooled specificity of VATS were 92.7% (87.6-95.8%), 91.0% (89-92%), and 58% (31-81%), respectively. The incidence of grade 2 (moderate to severe) endobronchial bleeding after transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and of post-procedural pneumothorax was 4.9% (2.2-10.7%) and 9.5% (5.9-14.9%), respectively. Conclusions: Although the diagnostic test accuracy measures of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy lag behind those of VATS, with an acceptable safety profile and potential cost savings, the former could be considered as an alternative in the evaluation of patients with diffuse parenchymal lung diseases.",
      "methods": "Systematic searches of Medline and PubMed from inception to December 2016 identified studies reporting diagnostic performance of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TLCB) or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs). Two-by-two tables (TP, FP, FN, TN) were constructed where possible. Primary outcome was diagnostic yield; failures included nondiagnostic biopsies or benign diagnoses later overturned by surgical biopsy. Pre-specified safety outcomes included endobronchial bleeding, pneumothorax, prolonged air leak (VATS), and 30-60 day mortality. Random-effects meta-analyses were used (CMA v2.2.064 for pooled yield and safety; Meta-DiSc v1.4 for sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and SROC). Heterogeneity was assessed with I2. QUADAS-2 was used for risk of bias.",
      "results": "Sixteen TLCB studies and fourteen VATS studies were included. TLCB: pooled diagnostic yield 83.7% (95% CI 76.9-88.8%; I2 86%), pooled sensitivity 87% (95% CI 85-89%; I2 94%), pooled specificity 57% (95% CI 40-73%; I2 0%), DOR 25.53 (95% CI 8.92-73.04). VATS: pooled diagnostic yield 92.7% (95% CI 87.6-95.8%; I2 85%), pooled sensitivity 91% (95% CI 89-92%; I2 91%), pooled specificity 58% (95% CI 31-81%; I2 0%), DOR 21.06 (95% CI 7.08-62.60). SROC AUC 0.85 (SE 0.07). Safety after TLCB: grade 2 (moderate to severe) endobronchial bleeding 4.9% (95% CI 2.2-10.7%); pneumothorax 9.5% (95% CI 5.9-14.9%)."
