      "abstract": "Interstitial lung diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders that are often difficult to diagnose precisely. Clinical, laboratory, radiographic, and histologic information may be needed to arrive at the correct diagnosis. The multidisciplinary discussion has been proven to be useful in this patient group. Transbronchial cryobiopsy has become a popular method for obtaining tissue samples. Over the last decade, substantial research has assessed the feasibility, safety, and diagnostic endpoints of transbronchial cryobiopsy in patients with interstitial lung disease. Data continue to mount to support its use, reflected in guidelines and expert panel reports. Patient selection, procedural performance, and appropriate specimen handling are critical for success. A coordinated approach by pulmonologists with expertise in interstitial lung diseases, interventional pulmonologists, and thoracic pathologists is essential. This evidence-based narrative review addresses transbronchial cryobiopsies from these three perspectives and uses current literature to address nine common procedural questions.",
      "methods": "MEDLINE and Cochrane Library were searched using the term \"cryobiopsy\" from 2009 through 2020. A total of 352 articles were found. Fifteen duplicates were removed. Seventy-four articles were excluded for reasons including non-parenchymal applications, other specialties or animal studies, lack of English full text, clinical trial registrations, duplicity, and microscopic applications of cryotechnology. After exclusions, 263 articles were selected for review; many were included in meta-analyses and guidelines and not individually referenced.",
      "results": "Meta-analyses report acceptable diagnostic yield for transbronchial cryobiopsy (TBC) in diffuse parenchymal lung disease: Sethi et al. analyzed 27 studies (1443 patients) with an overall yield of 72.9%; Sharp et al. (11 studies, 704 patients) reported 84.4%; Johannson et al. (11 studies, 731 patients) reported a pooled estimate of 79% (range 74%-98%); Ravaglia et al. (15 studies, 781 patients) reported 81%; the 2019 ACCP Guideline pooled estimate was 82.5%. In multidisciplinary discussion (MDD), adding TBC histology increased highly confident IPF diagnosis from 29% to 63% in a cohort of 117 fibrotic ILD patients (+34%). In a prospective multicenter study with sequential TBC and SLB, TBC-sourced information was useful to MDD in 48 of 65 patients (75%). Diagnostic concordance between TBC and SLB varied: an early prospective study found full histologic concordance in 8 of 21 cases (38%); a larger multicenter study reported raw agreement between TBC and SLB of 70.8% for guideline-refined pattern (weighted κ 0.70, 95% CI 0.55-0.86), 69.2% for specific histologic pattern (κ 0.47, 0.30-0.64), and 76.9% for final MDD diagnosis (κ 0.62, 0.47-0.78). Safety signals favored TBC: hospital length of stay was longer with SLB (6.1 vs 2.6 days). Mortality due to adverse events was higher with SLB than TBC (2.7% vs 0.3%). Elective SLB in-hospital mortality was 1.7% (nonelective 16%). SLB 30-day mortality up to 16.7% was observed in a single-center series of patients ultimately diagnosed with UIP. TBC 30-day mortality ranged 0%-4.0%; 90-day mortality 2.5% in one report; meta-analysis procedural mortality 0.3%; ACCP estimated 0.5%. TBC pneumothorax and severe bleeding were estimated at <10% and 0.3%, respectively; SLB bleeding was infrequent and often minimal (<20 mL)."
