      "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary carcinoids are rare tumors originating from neuroendocrine cells in the lungs. Because of their potentially infiltrative nature, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice. However, not all patients with technically resectable disease will be able to undergo surgery, primarily because of poor lung function or medical co-morbidities. Centrally located, intraluminal tumors have been reported to be amenable to bronchoscopic treatment. We specifically examined the role of cryotherapy in the treatment of bronchial carcinoid tumors. Methods: Sixty-three patients (52.38% female) who underwent a combined total of 243 cryotherapy procedures for treatment of bronchial carcinoid between 1992 and 2020 in our institution were included. Following multidisciplinary discussion, patients were considered for first-line cryotherapy when lung resection was deemed not possible or when they had rejected surgery. Results: Cryotherapy resulted in complete remission in 21 (33.33%) patients with maximum tumor diameter less than 20 mm (mean 11.08 mm, 95% CI 8.76-13.40), and allowed 22 (34.92%) patients with larger lesions (mean 24.04 mm, 95% CI 18.78-29.30) to proceed with parenchymal sparing resections. Marked symptomatic relief (P < 0.001) was reported by 58 (92.06%) patients. Median follow-up was 33 months (range 0-243). One (1.59%) patient had recurrence in a contralateral lobe 3 years after surgery and was treated with radiofrequency ablation. Conclusions: We provide evidence on the safety and efficacy of cryotherapy and encourage wider adoption of this inexpensive and minimally invasive technique for treatment of bronchial carcinoids.",
      "methods": "Retrospective, observational, single-center study including 63 patients treated with first-line bronchoscopic cryotherapy for endobronchial carcinoid between 1992 and 2020. Patients were discussed in a multidisciplinary team and selected for cryotherapy if lung resection was not possible due to poor pulmonary function or medical comorbidities, or if surgery was refused. Cryotherapy was performed under general anesthesia using flexible bronchoscopy via a Negus rigid bronchoscope with jet ventilation (alternatively via endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask). With the lesion in direct vision, the cryoprobe was applied typically for 4 minutes per application; number of applications depended on size, site, and macroscopic characteristics. Biopsy for histologic confirmation was taken via cryoextraction or forceps. Bleeding was managed with 10 ml boluses of adrenaline 1:100,000 and/or cryoprobe application at the bleeding point. Repeat bronchoscopy was scheduled within 4-6 weeks to assess response and resectability; further procedures were performed as indicated for cryodebulking or cryorecanalization. Antibiotics were prescribed based on clinical indications. Data were collected from archived research material, prospectively populated databases, operative logbooks, and medical records. Numeric data were summarized as mean (95% CI) or median (range). Tumor size was assessed radiographically at baseline; endoscopic/histopathologic findings were used to estimate size post-treatment, assigning 0 mm if no visible tumor and negative histology. A two-tailed t test was used to analyze tumor size before and after cryotherapy. Symptomatology and degree of airway obstruction before and after treatment were analyzed with the Wilcoxon paired-signed ranks test. Cases with insufficient data, including 2 patients lost to follow-up, were excluded from statistical analyses.",
      "results": "Sixty-three patients (52.38% female), median age 48 years (range 17-88), received first-line cryotherapy when considered inoperable (69.84%) or if they refused surgery (7.93%). Typical carcinoid in 58 (92.06%) and atypical in 5 (7.93%). Tumor location: main bronchus 20 (31.75%), bronchus intermedius 15 (23.81%), lobar bronchus 28 (44.44%). Median cryotherapy applications per patient were 3 (range 1-18); median interval between procedures 35 days (range 6-3556). Bronchoscopic cryotherapy resulted in marked symptomatic relief in 58 (92.06%) patients who had undergone 3 or fewer cryoablations (P < 0.001). No immediate or late postprocedural complications occurred; all patients were discharged the same day; none required re-admission. Transient cough with blood-stained sputum resolved within 3-5 days. Complete tumor removal with cryotherapy alone occurred in 18 (28.57%) patients with typical carcinoid; an additional 3 patients who underwent surgery had no residual tumor on final histology, totaling 21 (33.33%) with complete remission attributable to cryotherapy. Thirty-two (50.79%) patients underwent surgery after cryotherapy; tumor size reduction was achieved in 29/32 and 22 (34.92% overall) underwent bronchoplastic/sleeve parenchymal-sparing resections; none required more extensive resection than initially anticipated and 13 ultimately required lesser procedures, avoiding 9 pneumonectomies and 4 bilobectomies. Median follow-up for survivors as of July 2020 was 33 months (range 0-243). One patient had contralateral lobe recurrence 3 years after surgery, managed with radiofrequency ablation."
