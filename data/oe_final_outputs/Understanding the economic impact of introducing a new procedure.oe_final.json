      "abstract": "Over the last decade, endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) evolved into a validated and powerful diagnostic tool. Although it is integral to medical care in some health-care systems, others struggle to justify its purchase based on diminishing reimbursement. In analyzing its value to a health-care system, looking at procedural reimbursement alone will grossly underestimate its economic impact. Downstream revenue has been defined by administrators as revenue captured after patients use one hospital service and then use others. By analyzing consecutive EBUS cases and taking downstream revenue into account, 2400000 in collections was attributed to 97 patients who were newly referred for this procedure.",
      "methods": "Retrospective review of 200 consecutive EBUS-TBNA procedures performed at the Medical University of South Carolina between 2008 and 2009 (start date June 30, 2008). Patients were classified as established patients (EPs) or new patients (NPs) to the health-care system within 30 days of EBUS-TBNA. NPs were subdivided into new patient brief interaction (NPBI: <6 visits, no hospitalizations) and new patient continued care (NPCC). For NPs, collections (professional and technical) were obtained for services from 30 days prior to 180 days after the index procedure, restricted to services directly related to the EBUS-TBNA referral and subsequent diagnosis/treatment. For EPs, downstream services directly related to the EBUS-TBNA within 180 days were counted; collections were not calculated. Data abstracted included radiologic studies, consults, pathology, hospitalizations, procedures, and treatments.",
      "results": "Of 200 patients, 97 were EPs and 103 were NPs (59 NPBI, 44 NPCC). Lung cancer was present in 49% overall and metastatic cancer in 7%. Among NPs in the 30 days prior to EBUS-TBNA, there were 30 radiologic studies, 94 consults, and 28 procedures. Post-procedure encounters (within 180 days) included, for NPBI/NPCC/EP respectively: radiologic studies 22/275/305; consults 88/459/470; hospitalizations 0/33/31; procedures 14/44/61; radiation therapy 0/240/310; chemotherapy 0/88/88. The hospital collections attributable to NPs were 2400000, including 1970000 in technical fees and 440000 in professional fees. Private insurance accounted for 31% of payer mix. Approximately 43% of NPs (44/103) remained in-system for continued care (NPCC)."
