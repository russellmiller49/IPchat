      "abstract": "Purpose of review: To review tracheobronchial anatomy and the use of flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy in thoracic anesthesia. Recent findings: Mastery of tracheobronchial anatomy is essential for correct placement of lung isolation devices (double-lumen endotracheal tubes and bronchial blockers). Anatomical changes occur with aging and in COPD, affecting tracheal position and diameters, and must be recognized to optimize device placement. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is emphasized as a key skill for confirming and optimizing placement of lung isolation devices and for interventional procedures. Summary: Familiarity with airway anatomy and fiberoptic techniques is fundamental to safe and effective management of patients undergoing thoracic anesthesia.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of tracheobronchial anatomy, age/COPD-related anatomical changes, and flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy techniques relevant to thoracic anesthesia, including illustrative imaging examples and practical guidance for positioning double-lumen tubes and bronchial blockers. No new clinical trial or primary data collection was conducted.",
      "results": "Key anatomical parameters summarized include tracheal length (~15 cm), tracheal diameter averages (men ~22 mm, women ~19 mm), cricoid as the narrowest portion (men ~17 mm, women ~13 mm), and key bronchial distances (carina to right upper lobe take-off ~2.0 cm in men, ~1.5 cm in women; carina to left upper/lower bifurcation ~5.0 cm in men, ~4.5 cm in women). Age and COPD can shift the trachea (often rightward) and alter tracheal dimensions. A systematic bronchoscopy exam is described, including recognition of the right upper lobe trifurcation as a landmark distinguishing right from left bronchus. Evidence cited indicates auscultation/clamping alone can yield a high malposition rate for DLTs (reported up to 35%), whereas fiberoptic confirmation allows correction of malpositions. Practical steps and optimal positions for right- and left-sided DLTs and bronchial blockers are detailed, including cuff positioning relative to the carina and considerations when the right upper lobe take-off is close to the carina. Additional uses include guidance for endobronchial stent placement and post-airway-exchange catheter examinations."
