      "abstract": "Rationale: Chronic bronchitis (CB) is characterized by productive cough with excessive mucus production, resulting in quality-of-life impairment and increased exacerbation risk. Bronchial rheoplasty uses an endobronchial catheter to apply nonthermal pulsed electrical fields to the airways. Preclinical studies have demonstrated epithelial ablation followed by regeneration of normalized epithelium. Objectives: To evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of bronchial rheoplasty in patients with CB. Methods: Pooled analysis of two separate studies enrolling 30 patients undergoing bilateral bronchial rheoplasty was conducted. Follow-up through 6 months (primary outcome) and 12 months included assessment of adverse events, airway histology, and changes in symptoms using the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Assessment Test and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ). Measurements and Main Results: Bronchial rheoplasty was performed in all 30 patients (63% male; mean [SD] age, 67 [7.4]; mean [SD] postbronchodilator FEV1, 65% [21%]; mean [SD] COPD Assessment Test score 25.6 [7.1]; mean [SD] SGRQ score, 59.6 [15.3]). There were no device-related and four procedure-related serious adverse events through 6 months, and there were none thereafter through 12 months. The most frequent nonserious, device- and/or procedure-related event through 6 months was mild hemoptysis in 47% (14 of 30) patients. Histologically, the mean goblet cell hyperplasia score was reduced by a statistically significant amount (P < 0.001). Significant changes from baseline to 6 months in COPD Assessment Test (mean, -7.9; median, -8.0; P = 0.0002) and SGRQ (mean, -14.6; median, -7.2; P = 0.0002) scores were observed, with similar observations through 12 months. Conclusions: This study provides the first clinical evidence of the feasibility, safety, and initial outcomes of bronchial rheoplasty in symptomatic patients with CB. Clinical trial registered with www.anzctr.org.au (ACTRN12617000330347) and clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03107494).",
      "methods": "Two prospective, multicenter, single-arm clinical studies under nearly identical protocols were conducted at five tertiary academic centers in Austria, Australia, and Chile (ACTRN12617000330347; NCT03107494). Adults ≥40 years with ≥10 pack-years smoking history and CB (productive cough for 3 months in each of 2 successive years, other causes excluded) were eligible. Initially, post-bronchodilator FEV1 >30% and <80% predicted and FEV1/FVC <0.70 were required. A protocol amendment removed the FEV1/FVC criterion and allowed FEV1 >80% if CAT >10 and CAT cough+phlegm items ≥7. Exclusions included oral steroid-dependent conditions (>10 mg/day), active respiratory infection, COPD exacerbation within 6 weeks, abnormal cardiac rhythm, arrhythmia in past 2 years, implantable cardiac devices, prior lung surgery, history of asthma before age 30, and current smoking within 6 months. Patients were maintained on stable pharmacologic regimens. Bronchial rheoplasty (RheOx System) was performed under general anesthesia via bronchoscopy; pulsed electrical fields were delivered circumferentially to airway mucosa in contiguous activations from subsegmental airways to main carina, treating all accessible lobar segments/subsegments. The right lung was treated first with cryobiopsies; the left lung was treated ~1 month later with cryobiopsies; a third bronchoscopy at 3 months post-second treatment obtained bilateral biopsies only. Follow-up included phone calls at 1 week after each treatment and clinic visits at 1 month after the first treatment and at 3, 6 (primary assessment), and 12 months after the second treatment. Outcomes included safety (device- and procedure-related adverse events, spirometry), histology (goblet cell hyperplasia score at 3 months post-second procedure), and patient-reported outcomes (CAT and SGRQ at baseline, 3, 6, and 12 months). For longitudinal PROs, Friedman’s test was followed by pairwise Wilcoxon signed-rank tests with Hochberg adjustment.",
      "results": "Thirty patients were enrolled and completed bilateral bronchial rheoplasty (60 procedures). Mean (SD) age was 67 (7.4) years; 63.3% were male. Baseline mean (SD) post-bronchodilator FEV1% predicted was 65.0 (21.2); baseline CAT and SGRQ total scores were 25.6 (7.1) and 59.6 (15.3), respectively. A mean (SD) of 43 (21) activations were applied per lung; median hospital stay was 1 day (range 0-4), with 92% discharged within 48 hours. Through 6 months, there were no device-related SAEs and four procedure-related SAEs: pneumonia 2 days post-procedure (1), mucosal scarring related to cryobiopsy observed at second bronchoscopy (1), COPD exacerbation starting the day of the second procedure (1), and COPD exacerbation the day of the third bronchoscopy (1). No additional device- or procedure-related SAEs occurred from 6 to 12 months. The most frequent nonserious device/procedure-related AE through 6 months was mild hemoptysis in 14 of 30 patients (46.7%). Histology showed a statistically significant reduction in mean goblet cell hyperplasia score (P < 0.001). PROs improved from baseline to 6 months: CAT mean change -7.9 (median -8.0; P = 0.0002) and SGRQ mean change -14.6 (median -7.2; P = 0.0002), with similar observations through 12 months. Follow-up was available for 30/30 at 6 months and 29/30 at 12 months."
