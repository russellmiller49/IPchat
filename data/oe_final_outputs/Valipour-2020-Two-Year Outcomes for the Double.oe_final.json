      "abstract": "Purpose: COPD exacerbations are associated with worsening clinical outcomes and increased healthcare costs, despite use of optimal medical therapy. A novel bronchoscopic therapy, targeted lung denervation (TLD), which disrupts parasympathetic pulmonary innervation of the lung, has been developed to reduce clinical consequences of cholinergic hyperactivity and its impact on COPD exacerbations. The AIRFLOW-2 study assessed the durability of safety and efficacy of TLD additive to optimal drug therapy compared to sham bronchoscopy and optimal drug therapy alone in subjects with moderate-to-severe, symptomatic COPD two years post randomization. Patients and Methods: TLD was performed in COPD patients (FEV1 30-60% predicted, CAT≥10 or mMRC≥2) in a 1:1 randomized, sham-controlled, double-blinded multicenter study (AIRFLOW-2) using a novel lung denervation system (Nuvaira, Inc., USA). Subjects remained blinded until their 12.5-month follow-up visit when control subjects were offered the opportunity to undergo TLD. A time-to-first-event analysis on moderate and severe and severe exacerbations of COPD was performed. Results: Eighty-two subjects (FEV1 41.6±7.4% predicted, 50.0% male, age 63.7±6.8 yrs, 24% with prior year respiratory hospitalization) were randomized. Time-to-first severe COPD exacerbation was significantly lengthened in the TLD arm (p=0.04, HR=0.38) at 2 years post-TLD therapy and trended towards similar attenuation for moderate and severe COPD exacerbations (p=0.18, HR=0.71). No significant changes in lung function or SGRQ-C were found 2 years post randomization between groups. Conclusion: In a randomized trial, TLD demonstrated a durable effect of significantly lower risk of severe AECOPD over 2 years. Further, lung function and quality of life remained stable following TLD. Clinical Trial Registration: NCT02058459.",
      "methods": "Randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial (AIRFLOW-2; NCT02058459) in symptomatic moderate-to-severe COPD. Inclusion: age 40-75 years, post-bronchodilator FEV1/FVC <0.70, FEV1 30-60% predicted, mMRC≥2 or CAT≥10. Key exclusions: >2 respiratory-related hospitalizations in prior year, GCSI ≥18, previous lung/chest procedure. All subjects underwent inhaler washout, then were placed on tiotropium 18 μg/day and continued other maintenance medications as per treating physician. Subjects randomized 1:1 to TLD (Nuvaira dual-cooled RF system) or sham bronchoscopy. Blinding maintained to 12.5 months; thereafter, sham participants could elect cross-over to TLD; cross-over timing unrestricted. Outcomes collected at 6.5, 12.5 months and annually to 3 years. COPD exacerbations defined as moderate/severe if requiring systemic steroids and/or antibiotics, with severe defined as requiring hospitalization. Adverse events collected throughout. Statistical analyses: t-tests or non-parametric tests for continuous variables, Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, negative binomial regression for annualized exacerbation rates, and log-rank test/Cox model for time-to-first exacerbation. P<0.05 considered significant.",
      "results": "N=82 randomized (41 TLD, 41 control). At 2 years, retained: TLD n=36 (88%), control n=14 (after cross-over of 20 control subjects and 5 exits). Time-to-first severe COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization was significantly lower with TLD vs control at 2 years (HR=0.38; 95% CI 0.15-0.99; p=0.04). No significant difference in time-to-first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation (HR=0.71; 95% CI 0.42-1.18; p=0.18). Annualized rate of moderate/severe exacerbations: control 0.81 vs TLD 0.64 (p=0.54). Annualized rate of severe exacerbations: control 0.15 vs TLD 0.11 (p=0.71). In year 2, respiratory-related hospitalization occurred in 11.1% of TLD subjects (4/36) vs 28.6% of control subjects (4/14). Lung function (FEV1, FVC, TLC, RV) and SGRQ-C remained stable with no significant between-group differences at 2 years."
