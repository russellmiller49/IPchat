      "abstract": "Purpose: To compare peristomal infection rates following percutaneous gastrostomy (PG) after a single dose of prophylactic antibiotics versus placebo and evaluate rates of peristomal infection in patients receiving concurrent antibiotics. Materials and Methods: This single-center, randomized trial (2012-2016) enrolled 122 patients referred for image-guided PG; all enrolled patients completed the study. Of enrolled patients, 68 were randomly assigned to receive either antibiotics (n = 34) or placebo (n = 34) before PG placement. The remaining 54 patients were taking pre-existing antibiotics and were assigned to an observation arm. Stoma sites were assessed for signs of infection by a blinded evaluator at early (between 3-5 d and 7-10 d) and late (between 14-17 d and 28-30 d) time points after the procedure. The primary outcome was peristomal infection. Results: Under intention-to-treat analysis, early infection rate was 11.8% (4/34 patients; 95% CI, 0.0%-9.4%) in the placebo arm and 0.0% (0/34 patients; 95% CI, 0.0%-8.4%) in the antibiotic arm (P = .057 for comparison of infections in the 2 arms). Under per-protocol analysis, early infection rate was 13.3% (4/30 patients; 95% CI, 4.4%-29.1%) in the placebo arm and 0.0% (0/32 patients; 95% CI, 0.0%-8.9%) in the antibiotic arm (P = .049). The number needed to treat to prevent 1 early infection was 8.5 and 7.5 from the 2 analyses, respectively. Conclusions: There is a trend toward reduction in rate of peristomal infection after PG when prophylactic antibiotics are administered.",
      "methods": "Institutional review board approval was obtained to conduct this single-center, double-blind, randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01424085). Randomization was performed by the pharmacy department using a random number generator to assign patients to antibiotic or placebo arms. All patients, operators, nursing staff, and study staff were blinded to assignments in the randomized arm. Between May 2012 and February 2016, 517 patients underwent PG. All nonpregnant, English-speaking patients ≥ 18 years old were eligible. Patients were eligible for randomization only if they had not received antibiotics within 48 hours before PG; patients already receiving antibiotics at enrollment for other infections entered an observation arm. Patients in the antibiotic arm received a single dose 30 minutes before the procedure: cefazolin 1 g IV (n = 30) or clindamycin 600 mg IV if β-lactam-allergic (n = 4). Placebo was equal-volume normal saline. All patients had a 16-F push-type Deutsch gastrostomy tube with 3 absorbable gastropexy sutures placed. Stoma sites were evaluated by a blinded evaluator at 3-5, 7-10, 14-17, and 28-30 days. A validated scoring system was used; infection was defined as score ≥ 8 or frank purulence. Primary outcome was peristomal infection during 30 days, categorized as early (≤ 10 days) and late (11-30 days). Analyses used mid-P Fisher exact tests. ITT included all randomized with known assignment and early follow-up; PP excluded patients who received post-enrollment antibiotics for other indications before the early time point.",
      "results": "In ITT, early infections occurred in 4/34 placebo (11.8%; 95% CI, 3.9%-26.0%) and 0/34 antibiotics (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-8.4%); difference 11.8% (95% CI, 0.5%-25.1%; P = .057). No late infections were observed in either randomized arm. In PP, early infections were 4/30 placebo (13.3%; 95% CI, 4.4%-29.1%) vs 0/32 antibiotics (0.0%; 95% CI, 0.0%-8.9%); difference 13.3% (95% CI, 1.0%-28.1%; P = .049). In the observation arm, early infections were 1/54 (1.9%; 95% CI, 0.1%-8.8%); this was similar to the antibiotic arm (1.9% vs 0.0%; P = .61) and tended to be lower than placebo in ITT (1.9% vs 11.8%; P = .078) and PP (1.9% vs 13.3%; P = .063). One late peristomal infection occurred in the observation arm between days 28-30. All patients had adequate early follow-up; some were lost during late follow-up (antibiotic 3/34, placebo 2/34, observation 5/54)."
