      "abstract": "Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) is traditionally managed with an intercostal chest tube attached to an underwater seal. We investigated whether use of a one-way flutter valve shortened patients’ length of stay (LoS). This open-label randomised controlled trial enrolled patients presenting with SSP and randomised to either a chest tube and underwater seal (standard care: SC) or ambulatory care (AC) with a flutter valve. The type of flutter valve used depended on whether at randomisation the patient already had a chest tube in place: in those without a chest tube a pleural vent (PV) was used; in those with a chest tube in situ, an Atrium Pneumostat (AP) valve was attached. The primary end-point was LoS. Between March 2017 and March 2020, 41 patients underwent randomisation: 20 to SC and 21 to AC (13=PV, 8=AP). There was no difference in LoS in the first 30 days following treatment intervention: AC (median=6 days, IQR 14.5) and SC (median=6 days, IQR 13.3). In patients treated with PV there was a high rate of early treatment failure (6/13; 46%), compared to patients receiving SC (3/20; 15%) (p=0.11). Patients treated with AP had no (0/8; 0%) early treatment failures and a median LoS of 1.5 days (IQR 23.8). There was no difference in LoS between ambulatory and standard care. Pleural Vents had high rates of treatment failure and should not be used in SSP. Atrium Pneumostats are a safer alternative, with a trend towards lower LoS.",
      "methods": "Multi-centre open-label randomised controlled trial in 13 UK centres. Adults with secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (SSP) requiring chest tube drainage per BTS 2010 guidelines were randomised 1:1 to ambulatory care with a one-way flutter valve or standard care (chest tube attached to underwater seal). Initially the ambulatory device was the Pleural Vent (PV). After an ethics amendment, patients with a chest tube in situ for ≤36 h could receive an Atrium Pneumostat (AP) valve attached to the tube. Discharge with ambulatory device was permitted if clinically stable and pneumothorax stable. Suction and surgical referral were allowed in both arms. Follow-up to 26 weeks. Primary outcome: total hospital bed days due to SSP within 30 days of randomisation, including readmissions. Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney) for continuous outcomes and Chi-squared tests for categorical outcomes; intention-to-treat analysis.",
      "results": "Forty-one participants were randomised: 21 ambulatory (13 PV, 8 AP) and 20 standard care. Primary outcome: total hospitalisation in first 30 days median 6 days (IQR 1-15.5) ambulatory vs 6 days (IQR 2.25-15.5) standard care (p=0.77). Initial admission LoS: 1 day (IQR 1-14) ambulatory vs 3.5 days (IQR 2-7) standard (p=0.122). Time until medically fit for discharge: 1 day (IQR 1-1) ambulatory vs 2 days (IQR 2-6) standard (p=0.001). Time to chest tube removal: 3 days (IQR 1.5-9) ambulatory vs 2 days (IQR 1-6) standard (p=0.36). Failure of initial treatment within first week: 6/21 (28%) ambulatory vs 3/20 (15%) standard (p=0.29). Additional pleural procedure within 3 months: 8/21 (38%) ambulatory vs 6/20 (30%) standard (p=0.59). Thoracic surgery: 6/21 (29%) ambulatory vs 6/20 (30%) standard. Medical pleurodesis: 2/21 (10%) vs 2/20 (10%). Six-month ipsilateral recurrence: 4/21 (19%) vs 4/20 (20%). Subgroup within ambulatory: early treatment failure 0/8 (0%) AP vs 6/13 (46%) PV (p=0.046). An urgent safety review halted PV use due to high early failure."
