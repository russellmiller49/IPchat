      "abstract": "Introduction: Lung nodules are being identified with increasing frequency. With this growing burden of nodules comes a growing need for diagnostic technologies extending beyond the current reach of conventional bronchoscopy. One such method for diagnosing peripheral lung lesions is electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy (ENB), which comprises a set of tools designed to aid the bronchoscopist in identifying, accessing, and sampling peripheral lung lesions under virtual guidance. Areas covered: Herein we present an in-depth review of ENB, including commercially available electromagnetic navigation platforms, factors influencing diagnostic yield, adjunctive imaging and biopsy tools, potential risks, cost, technical shortcomings, and competing technologies. A review of the scientific literature was conducted primarily through PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar, and pertinent publications and abstracts from the inception of electromagnetic navigation through early 2020 were considered. We also share our perspective on the future of ENB from both a diagnostic and a therapeutic standpoint. Expert opinion: ENB is currently a leading tool in the diagnostic evaluation of peripheral lung lesions. The future of ENB rests not only on its potential to expand into the therapeutic realm but also on its ability to keep pace with competing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies.",
      "methods": "Narrative review. Literature searched primarily via PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar. Pertinent publications and abstracts from the inception of electromagnetic navigation through early 2020 were considered. No predefined protocol, randomization, or meta-analytic synthesis was reported.",
      "results": "The review describes three FDA-approved electromagnetic navigation platforms (superDimension, Veran SPiN, and Auris Monarch), outlines ENB workflow (planning, registration, navigation), factors influencing diagnostic yield (lesion size, location, bronchus sign, and biopsy modality), adjunctive tools (radial EBUS, fluoroscopy, cone-beam CT), risks (pneumothorax, bleeding, respiratory failure), and key limitations such as CT-to-body divergence. Reported diagnostic yield in the literature varies, with the largest recent prospective study cited at 73%. The authors discuss future directions including mitigation of CT-to-body divergence, integration with advanced imaging and fluoroscopic navigation, and potential therapeutic applications."
