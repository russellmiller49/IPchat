      "abstract": "Background: Endobronchial microwave ablation via flexible catheter offers the potential for local therapy for inoperable peripheral lung cancer. The study aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of navigation bronchoscopy-guided water-cooled microwave ablation catheter for nonsurgical peripheral lung cancer. Methods: This was a prospective single arm pilot study. Patients with early stage or multiple primary peripheral lung cancer who were nonsurgical candidates for surgery were enrolled in the study. Bronchoscopic microwave ablation was performed via a flexible water-cooled microwave ablation antenna under the guidance of navigation bronchoscopy. Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound combined with fluoroscopy was used to confirm the position. Treatment outcomes were evaluated based on follow-up chest CT and positron emission tomography scans. Primary endpoints were technical success and safety. Secondary endpoints were complete ablation rate, 2-year local control rate, and progression-free survival. Results: Thirteen patients were enrolled in the study from April 2018 to July 2019. A total of 19 sessions of microwave ablation were performed on 14 tumors under the guidance of navigation bronchoscopy. The technical success was 100%. Treatment-related complications occurred in two patients. The complete ablation rate was 78.6% (11/14). The 2-year local control rate was 71.4%. Median progression-free survival was 33 months for all patients. Conclusions: In this pilot study, bronchoscopic microwave ablation appears to be feasible with acceptable occurrence of complication in the treatment of peripheral lung cancer under the guidance of navigation bronchoscopy.",
      "methods": "This prospective single arm pilot study was approved by the local ethics committee (KS1737) and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02972177). Adults with pathologically confirmed peripheral lung cancers (clinical stage I per the 8th TNM) or multiple primary lung cancers (≤5 tumors, no nodal or distant metastases) who were ineligible for surgery or refused surgery were enrolled. Key exclusions were severe cardiopulmonary dysfunction or anesthesia contraindications, lack of bronchoscopic access to the lesion, or adjacency to large vessels/critical structures. Procedures were performed under general anesthesia via flexible bronchoscope with electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) or bronchoscopic transparenchymal nodule access (BTPNA) as needed. Radial probe endobronchial ultrasound (R-EBUS) and fluoroscopy confirmed lesion position. A flexible water-cooled microwave ablation (MWA) antenna was introduced through a peripheral catheter; power 50-80 W for 3-10 min per cycle, with additional cycles/paths for coverage. Post-procedure fluoroscopy screened for pneumothorax. Chest CT was obtained within 24-72 h. Follow-up contrast-enhanced CT occurred at 1 month and every 3 months for 2 years; PET-CT at 3 months assessed ablation efficacy. If inadequate at 3 months, repeat MWA was performed. Tumor response at 3 months was categorized as complete ablation, incomplete ablation, or local progression based on CT/PET-CT features by a multidisciplinary team. Primary endpoints: technical success (correct instrument placement and planned ablation completion) and safety (treatment-related complications within 30 days; CTCAE v4.0). Secondary endpoints: complete ablation rate (per lesion), 2-year local control rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). Survival and local control were estimated via Kaplan-Meier; median follow-up via reverse Kaplan-Meier.",
      "results": "Thirteen patients (median age 72, range 58-83) with 14 tumors (11 adenocarcinomas, 2 squamous cell carcinomas, 1 small cell lung cancer; mean long-axis 20.4 ± 5.7 mm) underwent 19 MWA sessions. Technical success was 100% (19/19). Mean ablation time per session was 13.8 ± 5.9 min; operation time 46.9 ± 18.8 min. One patient received systemic therapy post-ablation; no others received additional treatment. No procedure-related deaths occurred. Treatment-related complications occurred in 2 patients (grade 2): hydropneumothorax 15 days post-ablation managed with chest tube and antibiotics, and pneumothorax 4 h post-ablation managed with chest tube; session-level complication rate 10.5% (2/19). Of 14 tumors, complete ablation occurred in 11, incomplete in 1, and local progression in 2; complete ablation rate 78.6% (11/14). The 2-year local control rate was 71.4% with median follow-up 33 months (95% CI 30.6-35.4). Median PFS was 33 months (95% CI 15.0-51.0)."
