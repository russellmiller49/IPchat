      "abstract": "Background: Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disease, the most common type of which is autoimmune PAP. The gold standard therapy for PAP is whole lung lavage (WLL). Few studies have reported the optimal technique with which to evaluate the response to WLL. In this study, we aimed to identify parameters with which to assess the need for repeat WLL during a long‑term 8‑year follow‑up. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 patients with autoimmune PAP with 80 of whom underwent WLL. Physiologic, serologic, and radiologic features of the patients were analyzed during an 8‑year follow‑up after the first WLL treatment. Results: Of the 40 patients without any intervention, 39 patients either achieved remission or remained stable and only one died of pulmonary infection. Of the 56 patients who underwent WLL for 1 time, 55 remained free from a second WLL and 1 patient died of cancer. Twenty‑four required additional treatments after their first WLL. The baseline PaO2 (P = 0.000), PA‑aO2 (P = 0.000), shunt fraction rate (P = 0.001), percent of predicted normal diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO%Pred) (P = 0.016), 6‑min walk test (P = 0.013), carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (P = 0.007), and neuron‑specific enolase (NSE) (P = 0.003) showed significant differences among the three groups. The need for a second WLL was significantly associated with PaO2 (P = 0.000), CEA (P = 0.050), the 6‑minute walk test (P = 0.026), and DLCO%Pred (P = 0.041). The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut‑off value of 42.1% (P = 0.001) may help to distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL. Conclusions: WLL is the optimal treatment method for PAP and provides remarkable improvements for affected patients. The DLCO%Pred on admission with a cut‑off value of 42.1% may distinguish whether patients with PAP require a second WLL.",
      "methods": "We conducted a retrospective analysis of 120 adult patients with autoimmune PAP hospitalized from January 1, 1990 to January 1, 2014 at a single tertiary hospital in China. Inclusion required typical HRCT findings (crazy paving), milky BALF, and PAS‑positive material in BALF or lung biopsy. Patients <18 years or with secondary causes (e.g., silicosis, other inhalational syndromes, autoimmune diseases, malignancies, hematopoietic disorders) were excluded. Assessments included arterial blood gases (PaO2, PA‑aO2, shunt fraction), serum biomarkers (LDH, CEA, NSE, TC, TG), pulmonary function (FVC%Pred, FEV1%Pred, FEV1/FVC%Pred, TLC%Pred, DLCO%Pred), 6‑min walk test, and HRCT. Management: observation for mild/moderate symptoms; WLL if PaO2 <65 mmHg, PA‑aO2 >40 mmHg, or shunt fraction >10%. Repeat WLL if clinical/radiographic worsening. Statistics: paired t‑test for pre/post WLL, ANOVA/Kruskal-Wallis for group comparisons by WLL times (0, 1, >1), Pearson correlations, Cox regression (univariate/multivariate) to identify predictors of repeat WLL, ROC to determine DLCO%Pred cut‑off, Kaplan-Meier with log‑rank for time to repeat WLL. Two‑sided P < 0.05 significant.",
      "results": "Among 120 patients (88 male; mean age 43 ± 11 years), 56 underwent single WLL, 24 multiple WLL, and 40 observation only. No severe complications occurred among 80 WLL recipients. Over 8.6 years of follow‑up, 1/40 in observation died of pulmonary infection; 11 had spontaneous remission and 28 remained stable. In the single‑WLL group, 55/56 remained free from second WLL; 1 died of lung cancer ~3 years post‑diagnosis. Of the multiple‑WLL group (n=24), 13 were stable, 6 in remission, and 5 progressed at follow‑up end. Baseline comparisons across WLL‑times groups showed significant differences in PaO2 (P = 0.000), PA‑aO2 (P = 0.000), shunt fraction (P = 0.001), DLCO%Pred (P = 0.016), 6‑min walk test (P = 0.013), CEA (P = 0.007), and NSE (P = 0.003). Pre‑ vs post‑WLL among 80 patients showed improvements: PaO2 (59.0 ± 12.0 to 68.2 ± 12.9 mmHg; P = 0.000), DLCO%Pred (56.2% ± 17.6% to 66.8% ± 22.7%; P = 0.001), 6‑min walk distance (445.0 ± 132.4 to 546.2 ± 88.1 m; P = 0.016); PA‑aO2 and LDH decreased. Predictors of second WLL: univariate Cox—DLCO%Pred (P = 0.015; OR 0.961, 95% CI 0.931-0.992), 6‑min walk test (P = 0.025; OR 0.995, 95% CI 0.991-0.999), CEA (P = 0.009; OR 1.053, 95% CI 1.013-1.059), NSE (P = 0.041; OR 1.090, 95% CI 1.003-1.184). Multivariate adjusted for age, sex, smoking history: DLCO%Pred remained significant (P = 0.015; OR 0.961, 95% CI 0.931-0.992) but lost significance when further adjusting for PaO2, LDH, 6MWT, CEA, NSE. ROC identified DLCO%Pred cut‑off 42.1% (sensitivity 66.7%, specificity 80.0%; P = 0.001). Kaplan-Meier showed higher repeat‑WLL need in DLCO%Pred <42.1% vs >42.1% (P = 0.001)."
