      "abstract": "Background: Electromagnetic navigation bronchoscopy (ENB) has been widely adopted as a guidance technique for biopsy of peripheral lung nodules, but is limited by lack of real-time confirmation of biopsy devices. Intraprocedural cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with augmented fluoroscopy (AF) can assess or confirm device location. Objective: Determine safety and diagnostic yield (DY) of CBCT with AF during ENB-guided biopsy of peripheral lung nodules. Methods: Retrospective, single-center series of 75 consecutive patients undergoing ENB-guided biopsy with intraprocedural CBCT and AF; 3D segmentation (OncoSuite) was fused with live fluoroscopy for real-time guidance. Results: Ninety-three lesions (median 16.0 mm) were biopsied. Overall DY by lesion was 83.7% (95% CI, 74.8%-89.9%). Multivariate regression found no independent correlation of DY with lesion size, location, standard fluoroscopic visibility, or bronchus sign. Pneumothorax occurred in 3/75 patients (4%), with chest tubes in 2. Conclusion: ENB with CBCT-AF is feasible and effective, achieving high DY with low complication rates.",
      "methods": "Single-center retrospective study of 75 consecutive patients (September 2016-May 2017) undergoing ENB-guided biopsy in a hybrid OR with a C-arm CBCT system (Allura Xper FD20; Philips). After intubation under general anesthesia, an 8-second CBCT scan was acquired and lung nodules were segmented using OncoSuite. During ENB, segmented lesions were overlaid on live fluoroscopy (augmented fluoroscopy) to guide catheter positioning; geometric correspondence was maintained during C-arm/table/zoom changes. Additional CBCT scans were performed as needed. Radial EBUS was not used. Tissue sampling employed multimodality tools (cytology brush, 21/19G fine needle aspiration, forceps, GenCut, triple needle brush, BAL). Rapid on-site evaluation was used for all procedures. Primary outcome was diagnostic yield (specific malignant or benign diagnosis counted as diagnostic; nonspecific findings counted as indeterminate). Indeterminate cases were followed to classify true negatives and false negatives for sensitivity analysis. Multivariate regression assessed independent correlation of lesion size, location, fluoroscopic visibility, and bronchus sign with DY; significance threshold p<0.05. Radiation dose was estimated in a subset using dose-area product conversion (0.16 mSv/Gy·cm2). Analyses used R 2.15.0.",
      "results": "Ninety-three lesions in 75 patients were biopsied; 1 patient was lost to follow-up (excluded from performance analysis). Median lesion size was 16.0 mm (range 7-55). Most lesions were in the middle or peripheral third (94.6%). Bronchus sign on CT was present in 39%; 49% were visible on standard fluoroscopy. Mean fluoroscopy time was 6.2±2.6 minutes. Proven malignancy rate was 68.5% (63/92 lesions analyzed), with primary lung cancer in 53/92 lesions (stages I 35, II 2, III 4, IV 12); metastases 9 and lymphoma 1. Pneumothorax occurred in 3/75 patients (4%), with chest tube in 2; no significant hemorrhage or respiratory failure. Diagnostic yield by lesion was 83.7% (77/92; 95% CI, 74.8%-89.9%). Diagnostic accuracy was 93.5% (86/92; includes 9 indeterminate lesions later confirmed benign). Sensitivity for malignancy ranged from 91.3% (TP 63, FN 6) assuming 3 incomplete follow-ups were FN to 95.5% (TP 63, FN 3) assuming they were TN; prevalence of malignancy 71.7% to 75.0% under these assumptions. Multivariate regression showed no independent correlation of DY with lesion size, location, fluoroscopic visibility, or bronchus sign. In 9 patients, dose-area product was 31±16 Gy·cm2; estimated effective dose was 1.5±0.7 mSv (fluoroscopy) and 3.0±1.4 mSv (exposures), averaging 2.0 mSv per CBCT run with 1.5 runs per case."
