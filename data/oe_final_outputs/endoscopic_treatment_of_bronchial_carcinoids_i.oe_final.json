      "abstract": "Background: Surgery is the gold standard of lung carcinoid treatment. However, bronchoscopic treatment may provide a complete cure in selected patients. The aim of the study was to review the results of laser treatment of bronchial carcinoids and to compare the outcome after laser resection against the outcome after surgical resection. Methods: Seventy-three patients, 29 men and 44 women, median age 53 years (range, 23 to 78 y), with bronchial carcinoids were treated by surgical resection (n = 48) or endobronchial ablation (n = 25). Bronchoscopic treatment was also performed in 5 of 48 surgical patients as a part of the surgical treatment strategy. Results: Among 25 patients treated endoscopically, 16 were successfully treated with laser, whereas 9 were operated subsequently. One major complication was registered, as an inadvertent ventilation caused a nonfatal fire of the bronchoscope during Nd:YAG laser procedure. Forty-eight patients underwent surgical resection. Most of the patients underwent lobectomy and bilobectomy (30 and 5 patients, respectively). Four of the patients were dead by the end of the study, 1 was treated with laser, and 3 treated with surgical resection. The overall survival was 94.5% in the surgical group and 94.4% in the group treated with endoscopic ablation (P = 0.9). None of the 69 survivors had any sign of recurrence on computed tomographic scans and bronchoscopy by the end of the study. Conclusions: This is a retrospective study and no randomization has been performed. However, the results add evidence to the view that transbronchial laser treatment may be offered as a safe, stand-alone procedure in the treatment of typical carcinoid tumor in the central airways.",
      "methods": "Between 2002 and 2010, 73 patients (29 men and 44 women), with a median age of 53 years (range, 23 to 78 y) and bronchial carcinoids, were treated by surgical resection (n = 48) or endobronchial ablation (n = 25) in our institution. The criteria for laser ablation with curative intent were (1) presumably a typical type of tumor histology; (2) polypoid growth of the tumor; and (3) the absence of obvious distal metastases. Tumors localized distally to the subsegmental level were not treated with laser ablation. Patients who did not fulfill the criteria were treated with surgical lung resection. Bronchoscopic treatment was also performed in 5 of 48 surgical resection patients as part of the surgical treatment strategy. Data on demographics, histology, TNM staging, and perioperative information were collected. Survival rates between the laser and surgical groups were compared. The end-of-study date was March 1, 2011. SPSS (version 16.0) was used; a P-value <0.05 was considered significant.",
      "results": "Twenty-five patients were treated with Nd:YAG laser ablation (29 procedures; 21 single-procedure patients, 4 with multiple). Among 25 treated with curative-intent laser, 16 did not require surgery; 9 subsequently had surgery (5 lobectomies due to incomplete eradication). One major complication occurred: accidental ventilation with 100% oxygen caused a nonfatal fire in the flexible bronchoscope during Nd:YAG treatment. Postprocedural stenosis occurred in 2 patients and was treated with balloon dilatation. No significant bleeding and no perioperative mortality occurred. Forty-eight patients underwent surgical resection (wedge 7, segment 3, lobectomy 30, bilobectomy 5, pneumonectomy 3); in 3 patients operated after initial bronchoscopy, no tumor tissue was found in the resection specimen. Median follow-up was 3 years (range, 0.5 to 8). By study end, 4 patients had died (1 laser-only; 3 surgery-only). Overall survival was 94.5% in the surgical group and 94.4% in the laser group (P = 0.9). Survival in typical vs atypical carcinoids was 96.7% vs 81.8% (P = 0.05). None of the 69 survivors had recurrence on CT and bronchoscopy."
