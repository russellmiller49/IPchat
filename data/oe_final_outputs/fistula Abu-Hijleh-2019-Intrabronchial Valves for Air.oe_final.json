      "abstract": "Purpose Air leaks are common after lobectomy, segmentectomy, and lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). This can increase post-operative morbidity, cost, and hospital length of stay. The management of post-pulmonary resection air leaks remains challenging. Minimally invasive effective interventions are necessary. The Spiration Valve System (SVS, Olympus/Spiration Inc., Redmond, WA, US) is approved by the FDA under humanitarian use exemption for management of prolonged air leaks. Methods This is a prospective multicenter registry of 39 patients with air leaks after lobectomy, segmentectomy, and LVRS managed with an intention to use bronchoscopic SVS to resolve air leaks. Results Bronchoscopic SVS placement was feasible in 82.1% of patients (32/39 patients) and 90 valves were placed with a median of 2 valves per patient (mean of 2.7±1.5 valves, range of 1 to 7 valves). Positive response to SVS placement was documented in 76.9% of all patients (30/39 patients) and in 93.8% of patients when SVS placement was feasible (30/32 patients). Air leaks ultimately resolved when SVS placement was feasible in 87.5% of patients (28/32 patients), after a median of 2.5 days (mean±SD of 8.9±12.4 days). Considering all patients with an intention to treat analysis, bronchoscopic SVS procedure likely contributed to resolution of air leaks in 71.8% of patients (28/39 patients). The post-procedure median hospital stay was 4 days (mean 6.0±6.1 days). Conclusions This prospective registry adds to the growing body of literature supporting feasible and effective management of air leaks utilizing one-way valves.",
      "methods": "This is a prospective registry of 39 patients with significant PAL at 11 different institutions in the United States enrolled from May 2012 until July 2015. All patients had significant air leaks after lobectomy, segmentectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery using the FDA-approved SVS indications. Thirty-five patients had PAL ≥ 5 days (35/39 patients). Four patients (4/39) had SVS procedures earlier than 5 days (one patient at day 2, one patient at day 3 and two patients at day 4) due to severity of air leaks and concerns about clinical deterioration. Exclusion criteria included the presence of air leak only with cough or forced exhalation, presence of active asthma or pneumonia, inability to tolerate bronchoscopy, and inability to provide consent. The SVS valves were implanted and removed using flexible bronchoscopy. Sequential balloon occlusions were performed to identify airway(s) contributing to the air leak. Airway sizing was done using a sizing balloon catheter. The SVS valve was unsheathed through a catheter inserted within the working channel of the therapeutic bronchoscope. Removal was accomplished using flexible bronchoscopy and forceps to grasp the removal rod of the valve, removing the valve with the bronchoscope and biopsy forceps as one unit. Characteristics of air leaks were documented prior to and after placement, classified by severity (continuous, only during inspiration, only during expiration, or only during forced exhalation). Outcomes included positive responses to SVS placement, time to air leak resolution, and length of ICU and hospital stay. A positive response to valve placement was defined as complete air leak resolution immediately after the SVS procedure or improvement in air leak classification within 48 h after valve placement, or improvement allowing outpatient management with a Heimlich valve. Adverse events requiring SVS removal were documented. Statistics included percentages, means ± SD, medians, and ranges.",
      "results": "Thirty-nine patients underwent bronchoscopy with an intention to perform SVS placement, with a median of 9.5 days after the original surgical resection (mean ± SD of 23.8 ± 38.8 days; one patient excluded from this calculation due to 1236 days to procedure). Thirty-two patients (82.1%) had successful SVS procedures and 90 valves were placed (median 2 per patient; mean ± SD 2.7 ± 1.5; range 1-7). Seven patients (17.9%) did not have valves placed due to difficult anatomy, inability to localize leak, system leak at time of procedure, or spontaneous resolution. When SVS placement was feasible, 30/32 (93.8%) had a positive response. Considering all patients, 30/39 (76.9%) had a positive response. In patients with feasible SVS placement, complete resolution of air leak occurred in 28/32 (87.5%) with a median time to resolution of 2.5 days (mean ± SD 8.9 ± 12.4; range 1-45). Intention-to-treat resolution likely related to SVS was 28/39 (71.8%). Post-procedure ICU stay had a median of 0 days (mean ± SD 0.7 ± 2.2; range 0-10; n=32) and post-procedure hospital stay had a median of 4 days (mean ± SD 6.0 ± 6.1; range 0-27; n=32). Seventy-four of 90 valves were removed from 26 patients (27 removal procedures); 16 valves remained in 6 patients by study end. One patient required early valve removal for lobar (lingular) atelectasis causing dyspnea and hypoxia. All insertions were done under monitored anesthesia care or general anesthesia; 51% in the operating room and 49% in a bronchoscopy suite. Median bronchoscopy time for insertion was 48 minutes (mean ± SD 53.2 ± 27.9) and for removal was 21.5 minutes (mean ± SD 31.1 ± 30.4)."
