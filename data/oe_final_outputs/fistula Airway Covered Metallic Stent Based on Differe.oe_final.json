      "abstract": "Background: Malignant tracheoesophageal fistula (MTEF) is a devastating complication of esophageal cancer, lung cancer or other carcinoma with a shorter life-span and poor life quality. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of airway stent insertion on MTEF patients. Methods: A total of 63 MTEF patients were included, 12 patients with lung cancer and 46 patients with esophageal cancers. Eight zones were proposed to classify various fistula locations. Airway stents were selected based on the various zones and fistula size. Results: Airway stents were successfully inserted in all patients, and both airway and esophageal stents in 8 patients. Most fistula were located in locations II (18/63, 28.6%), III (22/63, 34.9%), then VII (9/63, 14.3%). The stents included 10 (15.9%) I shaped, 8 (12.7%) L shaped and 45 (71.4%) Y shaped. Different stents were placed based on different locations and sizes of fistulas. Overall, mean survival time was 163 days (2-270 days). Most symptoms relieved after stent insertion. Mean Karnofsky score jumped from 43.0 ± 10.7 before stent placement to 66.7 ± 10.8 after stent insertion (P < 0.001). Complete closure was achieved in 45 patients (71.4%), and incomplete closure and leakage were found in 18 patients. Conclusions: Airway stent insertion provides an effective approach to improve symptoms and quality of life. The choice of stent based on different fistula location and size may be a reasonable way in clinical practice.",
      "methods": "This investigation was a retrospective study approved by the Meitan General Hospital Institutional Review Board (IRB no. 2006.08). A total of 63 patients with malignant inoperable MTEF were treated using covered metallic airway stents from September 2006 to February 2014. Inclusion considered patients not suitable for surgery due to illness severity, higher surgical risk, or refusal, and who met at least one of: esophagus unsuitable for stenting, respiratory complications due to esophageal stent only, or airway stenosis. Airway stent choice (I-, L-, or Y-shaped Micro-Tech covered metallic stents) was based on an 8-zone airway location classification and fistula size (<1 cm vs >1 cm). Y stents were implanted with rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia; other stents with flexible bronchoscopy under general anesthesia. Baseline characteristics, fistula site, prior therapy, procedural success, symptom relief, and complications were recorded. Follow-up occurred at 1 month, then every 2 months or as needed; KPS was assessed pre-stent and at 1 month. Categorical data were analyzed with chi-square test; paired t test for manifestations before and after treatment; survival by Kaplan-Meier.",
      "results": "All 63 patients underwent airway stent insertion; 8 patients (12.7%) also received esophageal stents. Fistula locations: II (18/63, 28.6%), III (22/63, 34.9%), VII (9/63, 14.3%). Stents used: I-shaped 10 (15.9%), L-shaped 8 (12.7%), Y-shaped 45 (71.4%); 34 Y-shaped stents were placed in locations II and III. Symptoms before vs after stent placement: dyspnea 25/63 (39.7%) vs 2/63 (3.2%), P < 0.001; cough 63/63 (100%) vs 15/63 (23.8%), P < 0.001; pulmonary infection 63/63 (100%) vs 10/63 (15.9%), P < 0.001. Mean KPS increased from 43.0 ± 10.7 to 66.7 ± 10.8 (P < 0.001). Complete fistula closure occurred in 45/63 (71.4%); 18 had incomplete closure/leakage but stents were not removed due to clinical improvement. Complications: all patients had secretions adherence; chest pain in 28/63 (44.5%), with 2 stent removals due to intolerable pain; stent migration in 2/63 at days 3 and 4, both repositioned; massive haemoptysis in 2 patients with double stenting at days 30 and 65, both fatal within 2 days; airway restenosis in 2/63 at days 60 and 85 due to tumor progression. Median survival from stent insertion was 163 days (range 2-270). Causes of death included haemoptysis (n=2), malnutrition/cachexia (n=35), pneumonia/respiratory failure (n=17; including 2 after stent removal), acute myocardial infarction (n=2), airway restenosis (n=2), unclear (n=5)."
