      "abstract": "Introduction: Esophagorespiratory fistula (ERF) caused by esophageal cancer has a poor prognosis. This study describes the clinical effects of airway ultraflex stenting as an alternative method for ERF caused by esophageal cancer. Methods: In an university-affiliated hospital, consecutive patients with ERF caused by esophageal cancer and confirmed by bronchoscopy were included. The demography, clinical manifestations and survival between groups with and without airway stenting were compared by case-control study. Results: From 2001 to 2007, 817 patients with esophageal cancer received bronchoscopy. Among these patients, 59 patients with ERF were included in this study. The demography and clinical manifestations between groups with and without airway stenting were similar, but survival improved in group with airway stenting, which was compared using log-rank test [P = 0.04; hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.31-0.99]. After adjusted with age and gender by multinominal logistic regression, airway stenting [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 5.2; P = 0.01; 95% CI, 1.4-18.8], performance status (adjusted OR, 6.1; P = 0.004; 95% CI, 1.8-20.8), further treatment (adjusted OR, 8.7; P = 0.001; 95% CI, 2.3-32.8) and prolonged pneumonia (adjusted OR, 0.14; P = 0.008; 95% CI, 0.03-0.59) remained as significant factors that impacted survival. Conclusions: Surgical treatment remains the first choice in patients with esophageal cancer with ERF; however, the authors provided an alternative airway stenting for those patients whom surgery is unsuitable. It improved survival in the group with airway stenting than those without. Performance status improvement and further treatment for esophageal cancer may improve survival, but prolonged pneumonia may worsen survival.",
      "methods": "Design: Retrospective case-control study at a university-affiliated hospital (IRB no. 99-0337B). Patients: From August 2001 to March 2007, consecutive esophageal cancer patients underwent routine bronchoscopy; those with ERF on bronchoscopy and confirmed by esophagography were included. None were candidates for surgery or rigid bronchoscopic stenting. Decision for SEMS: No institutional standard; patients referred by oncologists were suggested SEMS unless they refused. Stent implantation: Covered Ultraflex (Boston Scientific) SEMS placed via flexible bronchoscopy under sedation (midazolam before 2006 or propofol with BIS after 2006) and local anesthesia without fluoroscopic guidance. Guidewire-assisted deployment under bronchoscopic visualization. Monitoring included SpO2, blood pressure, ECG. Assessment of 90-day mortality factors: performance status improvement, previous treatment at ERF diagnosis, stage IV at ERF diagnosis, ERF location, prolonged pneumonia, and receipt of further treatment after ERF diagnosis. Statistics: Nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney U; chi-square/Fisherâ€™s exact). Multinomial logistic regression adjusting for age and gender to identify independent factors impacting 90-day mortality (reported as adjusted ORs with 95% CI). Survival analyzed by Kaplan-Meier with log-rank test. Software: SPSS v10.0; Prism 4.",
      "results": "Of 817 esophageal cancer patients undergoing bronchoscopy, 59 had ERF and were included; 31 received airway SEMS and 28 did not. Baseline demographics, fistula site, stage, and prior treatments were similar between groups. Clinical manifestations (dyspnea, chronic cough, hemoptysis, respiratory failure) did not differ significantly between groups. Median survival from ERF diagnosis was 30 days (IQR 15-103). Median survival was 69 days (IQR 16-120) with SEMS vs 21 days (IQR 6-73) without. Survival favored SEMS (log-rank P = 0.04; HR 0.56; 95% CI 0.31-0.99). Univariate comparisons showed performance status improvement (67.7% vs 0%; P < 0.0001), receipt of further treatment after ERF diagnosis (41.9% vs 3.6%; P = 0.0005), and less prolonged pneumonia (58.1% vs 96.4%; P = 0.0005) in the SEMS group. Ninety-day mortality counts were 13/31 (41.9%) with SEMS vs 4/28 (14.3%) without (P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis adjusted for age and gender, performance status improvement (adjusted OR 6.1; P = 0.004; 95% CI 1.8-20.8), receipt of further treatment after ERF diagnosis (adjusted OR 8.7; P = 0.001; 95% CI 2.3-32.8), and prolonged pneumonia (adjusted OR 0.14; P = 0.008; 95% CI 0.03-0.59) were independently associated with 90-day mortality. No life-threatening complications from the stenting procedure were reported; mean stent placement time was 16.7 minutes (range 11.6-27.9)."
