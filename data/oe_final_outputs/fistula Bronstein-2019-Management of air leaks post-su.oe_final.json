      "abstract": "Air leaks are a common complication after elective lung resection. Despite advances in thoracic surgery, air leaks persist and can prolong hospitalization, increase pain and costs, and lead to infectious complications. This review discusses a stepwise approach to persistent air leaks, including conservative management with water seal (removing suction), fibrin patches/sealants, chemical pleurodesis (e.g., doxycycline), endobronchial valves, return to the operating room for surgical intervention, and outpatient management with portable drainage systems.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of management strategies for persistent air leaks following elective pulmonary resection, summarizing available randomized and nonrandomized studies and expert practice considerations.",
      "results": "The review synthesizes evidence that early use of water seal can shorten air-leak duration compared with routine suction in selected patients, describes bedside application and risks of fibrin sealants and chemical pleurodesis, outlines localization and placement techniques for endobronchial valves with reported effectiveness and complications, and reviews indications for operative re-intervention. It also discusses criteria and practical steps for discharging patients with a portable drainage system when appropriate."
