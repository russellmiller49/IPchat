      "abstract": "Background Nonmalignant esophago-respiratory fistulas (ERF) are frightening clinical situations, involving surgery with high morbi-mortality rate. We described the endoscopic management of benign ERF. The aim of the study was to describe outcomes of endoscopic treatment of nonmalignant ERF and to analyze factors associated with its success. Methods This is a retrospective study involving patients managed for benign ERF in our center between 2012 and 2016. The ERFs were classified into three groups of sizes: (I) punctiform, (II) medium, and (III) large. The primary aim was to document the endoscopic success (= fistula’s healing after 6 months). The secondary objectives were characteristics of endoscopic treatment, the functional success and death, and identifying factors associated with success and death. Results 22 patients were included. The etiologies of ERF were surgery in 12 patients, esophageal dilatation in 3, invasive ventilation in 3, radiation therapy in 2, and tracheostomy in 2. Ninety-three procedures were performed (mean of number: 4.2 ± 4.5/patient). Twenty-one patients had stent placement, eight over-the-scope clips (OTSC), and seven a combined therapy. The endoscopic success rate was 45.5% (n= 10; 67% in punctiform, 50% in medium, and 14% in large ERF), and the functional success was 55% (n= 12). Serious adverse events occurred in 9 patients (40.9%). Six patients died (27%). The persistence of the orifice after 6 months of endoscopic treatment was associated with failure (OR 44; IC95: 3.38-573.4; p= 0.004 multivariate analysis). The orifice’s size was associated with mortality [71% of death if large fistulas (p= 0.001) univariate analysis]. Conclusion Endoscopic treatment of ERF leads to 45.5% of successful endoscopic closure and 55.5% of functional success, depending on fistula’s orifice size. After 6 months without healing, the chances for success dramatically decrease.",
      "methods": "Retrospective analysis of consecutive adults with benign esophago-respiratory fistulas (ERF) treated endoscopically at a single tertiary-care center (Hospital North, Marseille, France) from July 2012 to December 2016. Inclusion: age ≥18, benign ERF with fluoroscopic confirmation during endoscopy, treated by endoscopy. Exclusion: age <18, malignant ERF, esophago-pleural fistula, treatment before July 2012, incomplete data. ERF orifice size classified endoscopically: I punctiform (< closed biopsy forceps diameter), II medium (larger without bronchial visibility), III large (direct bronchial visibility). Management strategy: attempt OTSC for recent, small, nonfibrotic orifices; if not feasible/satisfactory or large/fibrotic (>10-15 mm), place fully covered self-expandable metallic esophageal stent (FC‑SEMS). Adjuncts included monopolar coagulation and through-the-scope clips; combined approaches allowed. Contrast injection under fluoroscopy at procedure end to check leakage. Planned stent removal at 6 weeks for reassessment/re-treatment. Primary endpoint: successful endoscopic closure (closure on X‑ray contrast after stent removal and no recurrence at 6 months with oral diet). Secondary endpoints: functional success (normal oral intake without ERF symptoms with or without persistent orifice) and overall mortality; identification of factors associated with success and death. Statistics: descriptive; categorical comparisons with Chi-square or Fisher’s exact; continuous with t-test/ANOVA; survival by Kaplan-Meier with log-rank. Variables with p<0.20 or clinical relevance entered into multivariate logistic regression. Significance p<0.05.",
      "results": "Thirty-nine ERF patients identified; 17 excluded (malignancy 12, age <18 1, missing data 1, before July 2012 2, esophago-pleural fistula 1). Twenty-two benign ERF patients analyzed (13 men, 9 women; mean age 58 years). Etiologies: post-surgery 12 (54.5%), repeated dilatation 3 (13.6%), invasive ventilation 3 (13.6%), radiation therapy 2 (9.1%), post-tracheostomy 2 (9.1%); prior thoracic radiation in 11 (50%). Locations: trachea 17 (77.3%), right bronchus 3 (13.6%), left bronchus 2 (9.1%). Orifice size: stage I 9, stage II 6, stage III 7. Ninety-three endoscopic procedures (median 2 per patient); 20/22 (90.9%) had at least one FC‑SEMS (mean 3.9 ± 3.4 per patient), 17 OTSC placed across 8 patients. Serious adverse events linked to esophageal stents in 9 patients (40.9%): GI bleeding due to mucosal erosion 4 (18.2%), stent migration 4 (18.2%), thoracic spondylodiscitis 2 (9.1%), food impaction 1 (4.5%), stent mucosal impaction 1 (4.5%), major chest pain 1 (4.5%). Six patients (27.3%) died of pulmonary complications. Successful endoscopic closure achieved in 10/22 (45.5%) in mean 3 ± 3.9 months; functional success in 12/22 (55%). OTSC attempted in 8 patients with success in 2 (25%). Predictors: in univariate analysis, tracheotomy at diagnosis associated with failure (p=0.027). Multivariate: absence of closure at 6 months associated with final failure (OR 44; 95% CI 3.38-573.4; p=0.004). Mortality associated with orifice size: 0/9 deaths in punctiform (p=0.017); 5/7 (71.4%) deaths in large orifices (p=0.001). Mean follow-up 13.8 ± 14 months."
