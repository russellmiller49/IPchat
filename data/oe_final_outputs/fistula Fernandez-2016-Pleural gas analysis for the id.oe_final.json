      "abstract": "Purpose of review—The method for identification of alveolopleural fistulae (APF) by visual inspection of air bubbles in the chest drainage system has several limitations and suffers from poor accuracy. Here we discuss the use of a novel technique of pleural gas analysis in the identification and management of APF. Recent findings—We found that pleural gas analysis has higher sensitivity and specificity than visual identification in identifying APF. Additionally, we demonstrated that intrapleural gas milieu impacts lung healing and reduction of intrapleural carbon dioxide can promote resolution of APF. Summary—Pleural gas analysis is a novel technique to identify and manage APF. Integration of gas analysis in chest drainage systems would provide a more objective method for managing chest tubes and providing a favorable pleural gas environment for lung healing.",
      "methods": "Narrative review summarizing current analogue and digital chest drainage systems, limitations in visual inspection for air leaks, and clinical validation studies of pleural gas analysis (GA). Described a prospective diagnostic accuracy comparison of GA vs visual inspection (VI) in 50 lobectomy patients and a prospective cohort of 116 consecutive lung resections assessing associations between intrapleural gas milieu and healing, including a pragmatic intervention (increased suction and supplemental oxygen) for patients with intrapleural CO2 >6%. Pleural gas measurements used a Datex analyzer connected to the drainage system sampling port. APF definition by GA: CO2 >1% and increase in O2 of ≥2% with 5 L/min supplemental O2.",
      "results": "In APF-negative vs APF-positive groups, mean pleural CO2 was 0.9% vs 4.9%. Supplemental O2 5 L/min increased pleural O2 by ≥2% in APF-positive but not APF-negative patients (even with up to 10 L/min). In 50 lobectomy patients, GA vs VI showed concordance in 36/50 (19 positive, 17 negative). Twelve patients were VI-positive but GA-negative; chest tubes were removed without pneumothorax. Two patients were VI-negative but GA-positive; chest tube removal led to large pneumothorax. Of 29 GA-negative patients, 1 developed pneumothorax after tube removal; on tube replacement GA was positive. Overall APF incidence was 44%. Table 1 reported GA vs VI: sensitivity 95.5% vs 86.4%, specificity 100% vs 57.1%, PPV 100% vs 61.3%, NPV 96.6% vs 84.2%. In 116 resections, each 1% increase in intrapleural CO2 was associated with 9-hour delay in healing (p<0.001) and 10-fold higher odds of prolonged air leak (p=0.003). In patients with intrapleural CO2 >6%, an intervention (suction to -40 cm H2O plus O2 up to 8 L/min) reduced intrapleural CO2 from 6.6±0.7% to 3.1±0.5% and increased O2 from 15.4±2.0% to 27.1±3.2%, with shorter air leak duration vs standard management: 3.4±1.1 vs 6.0±1.2 days."
