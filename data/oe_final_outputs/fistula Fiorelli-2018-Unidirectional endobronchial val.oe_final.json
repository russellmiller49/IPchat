      "abstract": "Background: To evaluate the efficacy of Endo-Bronchial Valves in the management of persistent air-leaks (PALs) and the procedural cost. Methods: It was a retrospective multicenter study including consecutive patients with PALs for alveolar pleural fistula (APF) undergoing valve treatment. We assessed the efficacy and the cost of the procedure. Results: Seventy-four patients with persistent air leaks due to various etiologies were included in the analysis. In all cases the air leaks were severe and refractory to standard treatments. Sixty-seven (91%) patients underwent valve treatment obtaining a complete resolution of air-leaks in 59 (88%) patients; a reduction of air-leaks in 6 (9%); and no benefits in 2 (3%). The comparison of data before and after valve treatment showed a significant reduction of air-leak duration (16.2±8.8 versus 5.0±1.7 days; P<0.0001); chest tube removal (16.2±8.8 versus 7.3±2.7 days; P<0.0001); and length of hospital stay (LOS) (16.2±8.8 versus 9.7±2.8 days; P=0.004). Seven patients not undergoing valve treatment underwent pneumo-peritoneum with pleurodesis (n=6) or only pleurodesis (n=1). In only 1 (14%) patient, the chest drainage was removed 23 days later while the remaining 6 (86%) were discharged with a domiciliary chest drainage removed after 157±41 days. No significant difference was found in health cost before and after endobronchial valve (EBV) implant (P=0.3). Conclusions: Valve treatment for persistent air leaks is an effective procedure. The reduction of hospitalization costs related to early resolution of air-leaks could overcome the procedural cost.",
      "methods": "This was a multicenter, retrospective study including six high-volume Italian centers with experience in the EBV procedure. Consecutive patients with PALs observed from January 2011 to October 2016 were reviewed. Inclusion criteria: PALs due to APF persisting >5 days and refractory to conventional treatments; patients unfit or at high risk for surgery; PALs not controlled by domiciliary pleural drainage. Exclusion criteria: PALs due to broncho-pleural fistula; incomplete medical record or follow-up. Decisions regarding timing of EBV placement and removal, chest tube management, additional procedures after EBV failure, and discharge planning were center-directed. All patients were treated with Zephyr EBV. Air-leaks were assessed daily and graded by Cerfolio’s classification. Balloon occlusion with a Fogarty catheter was used to localize the leak. EBV sizes 4.0 and 5.5 were selected based on bronchial lumen diameter. Cost analysis included daily hospital cost, pharmacy charges, valve and equipment costs, and operating room charges. Statistical analysis used Kolmogorov-Smirnov for normality, Fisher’s exact test for categorical variables, Student’s t-test for continuous variables, and ANOVA for multiple comparisons; P<0.05 considered significant.",
      "results": "Seventy-four patients met inclusion criteria; 67 (91%) underwent EBV placement and 7 (9%) did not due to failure to localize the leak with balloon occlusion. Etiologies: postoperative (n=42), secondary spontaneous pneumothorax (n=24), primary spontaneous pneumothorax (n=2), iatrogenic (n=6). Most air-leaks were severe (Cerfolio grade 4). Prior to EBV, additional treatments included autologous blood patch (n=8), talc pleurodesis (n=11), and pneumoperitoneum (n=6). Mean time from chest tube placement to EBV implant was 16.2±8.8 days. EBV procedures were performed with sedation in 92% without intra-procedural complications or deaths. Outcomes in EBV patients: complete resolution in 59/67 (88%) at 2.9±1.4 days post-implant; moderate reduction in 6/67 (9%) requiring adjunctive pneumoperitoneum (n=4) or blood patch (n=2) with resolution 14.6±1.8 days later; persistence in 2/67 (3%) managed with surgery (n=1) or additional valve plus blood patch (n=1), both discharged with domiciliary drainage removed at 70 and 180 days. Pre- vs post-EBV comparisons showed reductions in air-leak duration (16.2±8.8 vs 5.0±1.7 days; P<0.0001), time to chest tube removal (16.2±8.8 vs 7.3±2.7 days; P<0.0001), and LOS (16.2±8.8 vs 9.7±2.8 days; P=0.004). In the 7 patients without EBV, 3/7 (43%) had mild leak reduction, only 1/7 (14%) had in-hospital chest tube removal at 23 days, and 6/7 (86%) were discharged with domiciliary drainage (LOS 47±13 days). Follow-up (mean 37.7±4.1 months): no atelectasis; one hemoptysis resolved after valve removal; valves were removed in 55/67 (82%) at 134±83 days without complications or recurrence; 12 patients retained valves without complications. In non-EBV patients, 4/6 had chest drainage removed after 157±41 days; 2/6 developed empyema requiring thoracoscopic decortication. Cost analysis showed reductions after EBV in hospital stay cost (€10,283±5,104 vs €6,761±1,823; P=0.035) and pharmacy cost (€126±8.9 vs €81.3±19.6; P=0.017); total healthcare cost did not differ (before €10,411±5,159 vs after €12,132±1,857; P=0.374)."
