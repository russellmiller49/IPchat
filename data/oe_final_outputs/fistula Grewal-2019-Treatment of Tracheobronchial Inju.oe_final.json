      "abstract": "Tracheobronchial injury is a rare but a potentially high-impact event with significant morbidity and mortality. Common etiologies include blunt or penetrating trauma and iatrogenic injury that might occur during surgery, endotracheal intubation, or bronchoscopy. Early recognition of clinical signs and symptoms can help risk-stratify patients and guide management. In recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the management of tracheal injury towards minimally invasive modalities, such as endobronchial stent placement. Although there are still some definitive indications for surgery, selected patients who meet traditional surgical criteria as well as those patients who were deemed to be poor surgical candidates can now be managed successfully using minimally invasive techniques. This paradigm shift from surgical to nonsurgical management is promising and should be considered prior to making final management decisions.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of contemporary diagnosis and management of tracheobronchial injuries, summarizing epidemiology, risk factors, clinical presentation, diagnostic approach (CT and bronchoscopy), morphologic classification (Cardillo levels I-IIIB), and therapeutic strategies including conservative care, surgical repair, and minimally invasive bronchoscopic stenting. No predefined systematic search strategy, inclusion, or exclusion criteria were reported.",
      "results": "The review highlights underrecognized iatrogenic and traumatic etiologies, provides practical diagnostic steps prioritizing bronchoscopy as the gold standard, and outlines management by injury depth and clinical status. Level I injuries are generally managed conservatively; level II injuries require individualized management; level IIIA/IIIB injuries often require surgery, though airway stenting can be considered in poor surgical candidates. Indications for urgent surgery include worsening subcutaneous emphysema, progressive pneumomediastinum, pneumothorax with persistent air leak or failed reexpansion, esophageal wall prolapse, and failure to ventilate. Multidisciplinary coordination and, when necessary, ECMO as a bridge are emphasized."
