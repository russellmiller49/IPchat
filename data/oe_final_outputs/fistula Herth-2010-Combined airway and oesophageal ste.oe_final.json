      "abstract": "Malignant airway-oesophageal fistulas (AEF) are a serious complication of advanced oesophageal or lung cancer. The aim of this study was to assess the quality of life before and after stent insertion, and to examine the role of treatment and location of AEF as factors influencing survival in AEF patients managed with airway and/or oesophageal stent insertion. 112 patients with AEF were included prospectively. 83 (74%) patients had advanced lung cancer and 29 (26%) patients had oesophageal cancers. Airway stents were inserted in 65 (58%) patients, oesophageal stents in 37 (33%) patients, and both airway and oesophageal stents in 10 (9%) patients. Seven (6%) patients developed respiratory failure and required transient ventilator support in the intensive care unit. None of the patients developed stent migration or needed stent repositioning. Overall, mean survival was 236.6 days (airway stent 219.1 days, oesophageal stent 262.8 days and combined airway-oesophageal stent 252.9 days). Backward, stepwise regression revealed the site of stent placement (airway and/or oesophagus; p<0.028), exact location of the fistula in airway (p=0.011) and additional treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation (p<0.001) as independent risk factors predicting increased survival. The mean quality of life score (QoL) was 81 prior to stent insertion and 72 post-stent insertion (p<0.001). Airway and/or oesophageal stent insertion provides an effective approach to improve the QoL in patients with malignant AEF.",
      "methods": "Prospective inclusion of consecutive patients with malignant airway-oesophageal fistula (AEF) secondary to oesophageal or lung cancer over 3 years. Stent type and location (airway and/or oesophagus) were selected based on stenosis location; if a single stent failed to close the fistula on dye testing, an immediate second stent was placed in the other system. Procedures were under general anaesthesia using flexible video bronchoscopy, rigid bronchoscopy or oesophagogastroduodenoscopy. Ultraflex nitinol self-expandable metallic stents (airway and/or oesophageal) were used. Fluoroscopy was used for oesophageal stents; airway stents were placed under endoscopic visualisation. Baseline characteristics, concomitant therapies (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, surgery), technical success, complications and survival were recorded. Quality of life (EORTC QLQ-C30) was assessed pre-stent and at 6 weeks post-stent. Statistics: survival times (uncensored) as means with 95% CI; between-group comparisons by ANOVA F-test; multiple linear regression with backward elimination to identify predictors of survival; constrained multiple correspondence analysis to assess relative importance; paired t-test for QoL change. Analyses used R.",
      "results": "112 patients (98 males; median age 52 years) underwent stenting for malignant AEF: airway stent 65 (58%), oesophageal stent 37 (33%), double stents 10 (9%). All had initial fistula closure. Respiratory failure occurred in 7 (6%) requiring <1 day of mechanical ventilation (4 airway, 2 oesophageal, 1 double). No stent migration or repositioning; no perforation or mediastinitis. No 30-day deaths. Mean survival overall 236.6 days (95% CI 221.5-251.6); airway 219.1 (95% CI 197.3-240.9), oesophageal 262.8 (95% CI 244.4-281.3), double 252.9 (95% CI 192.9-312.9); ANOVA p=0.023 with lower survival for airway-only vs others. Regression identified stent site (p<0.011), fistula localisation in airway (p=0.023), and added chemo/radiotherapy (p<0.001) as independent predictors of longer survival. QoL improved from mean 81 pre-stent to 72 at 6 weeks post-stent (paired t-test p<0.001). During follow-up, fistula recurred in 24 patients (17 airway, 6 oesophageal, 1 double), requiring a second stent."
