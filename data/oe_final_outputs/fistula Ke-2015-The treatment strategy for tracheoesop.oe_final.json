      "abstract": "With the development of endoscopic techniques, the treatment of tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) has made marked progress. As surgical intervention is often not an advisable option due to advanced malignancy and poor performance status of the patients, bronchoscopic intervention provides a good choice to palliate symptoms and reconstruct the airway and esophagus. In this review, we focus on the application of interventional therapy of TEF, especially the application of airway stenting, and highlight some representative cases referred to our department for treatment.",
      "methods": "Narrative review of interventional management strategies for tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF), emphasizing airway and esophageal stenting approaches. Includes a single-center case series from the authors' department (July 2013 to June 2015) of 61 consecutive TEF patients treated with airway stenting (43 metallic covered stents; 18 silicone Dumon stents), with definitions for clinical response (complete, partial, failure) assessed using contrast radiography and symptom resolution at >2 weeks.",
      "results": "In the single-center series (n=61), overall clinical response (complete or partial) was achieved in all patients. Metallic stent group (n=43): complete response 28 (65.1%), partial response 15 (34.9%). Of 25 patients who underwent double stenting (airway + esophageal), 24 (96%) achieved complete response. Silicone (Dumon) stent group (n=18): complete response 13 (72.2%), partial response 5 (27.8%). All 10 patients who underwent double stenting achieved complete response. Authors conclude metallic and silicone stents show equivalent effects, with slightly higher complete response in silicone group (P>0.05)."
