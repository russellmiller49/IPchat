      "abstract": "Objective: Neoadjuvant therapy has been extensively analyzed in studies addressing the risk factors of bronchopleural fistula, but their results vary hugely. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to determine the association between neoadjuvant therapy and risk of bronchopleural fistula in patients undergoing lung cancer surgery. Methods: We searched PubMed and EMBASE to identify the full-text literatures that met our eligibility criteria. Odds ratio with 95% confidence interval served as the summarized statistics. Heterogeneity within this meta-analysis was evaluated by Q-test and I2 statistic. Sensitivity analysis was performed for further assessments of robustness. Publication bias was detected by Begg’s test and Egger’s test. Results: Thirty studies enrolling 14 912 lung cancer cases were included into this meta-analysis. The incidence of bronchopleural fistula was 2.4% (354/14 912) in the large scale. Overall, neoadjuvant therapy significantly increased the risk of bronchopleural fistula after pulmonary resections (odds ratio: 2.166; 95% confidence interval: 1.398-3.357; P = 0.001). In subgroup analysis, neoadjuvant radiotherapy (odds ratio: 3.914; 95% confidence interval: 1.401-10.935; P = 0.009) and chemo-radiation (odds ratio: 2.533; 95% confidence interval: 1.353-4.741; P = 0.004) were significantly associated with the bronchopleural fistula risk but neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not (odds ratio: 1.857; 95% confidence interval: 0.881-3.911; P = 0.104). The impact of neoadjuvant therapy on bronchopleural fistula occurrence remains statistically prominent in the other subgroups. Conclusions: Neoadjuvant therapy is significantly associated with the occurrence of bronchopleural fistula after lung cancer surgery. Both neoadjuvant radiotherapy and chemo-radiation significantly increase the bronchopleural fistula risk but neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not. Some limitations still exist in this meta-analysis. The updated high-quality studies can help to further confirm and enrich our discoveries in the future.",
      "methods": "We conducted this systematic meta-analysis in accordance with PRISMA. PubMed and EMBASE (Ovid) were searched for English-language studies from 1 January 1990 to 24 August 2015 using terms related to bronchopleural fistula, neoadjuvant/induction/preoperative therapy, and risk/incidence/etiology. Inclusion criteria: primary lung cancer; postoperative BPF; assessment of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy; availability of primary demographic data or effect estimates (OR/RR/HR). Exclusions: reviews, letters, animal experiments, case reports, conference abstracts; uncertain neoadjuvant therapy or BPF details; non-lung cancer or benign disease; non-English. Study quality was assessed with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs were the summary statistics; where necessary, RRs/HRs were treated as ORs due to low BPF incidence. Fixed-effects models (Mantel-Haenszel) were used when I2 < 40% and P > 0.1; otherwise, random-effects models (DerSimonian-Laird) were used. Sensitivity analyses were performed by omitting studies contributing to heterogeneity. Publication bias was assessed with Begg’s and Egger’s tests. Analyses were performed in STATA 12.0.",
      "results": "Thirty retrospective observational studies (1992-2014) with 14,912 patients undergoing lung cancer resections (∼99.8% NSCLC) were included. Overall BPF incidence was 2.4% (354/14,912). Thirteen studies compared NT + surgery vs surgery alone; 17 studies evaluated risk factors by BPF vs non-BPF classification. Pooled analysis: neoadjuvant therapy increased BPF risk (OR 2.166; 95% CI 1.398-3.357; P = 0.001). Subgroups: neoadjuvant radiotherapy (OR 3.914; 95% CI 1.401-10.935; P = 0.009) and neoadjuvant chemoradiation (OR 2.533; 95% CI 1.353-4.741; P = 0.004) were associated with increased BPF risk, whereas neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not (OR 1.857; 95% CI 0.881-3.911; P = 0.104). The association remained in other subgroup analyses. Mean NOS score was 7.6/9, indicating generally good quality."
