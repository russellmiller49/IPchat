      "abstract": "Objective The aim of this article was to clarify recent risk factors for the early bronchopleural fistula after anatomical lung resection. Methods Reports on early bronchopleural fistula after anatomical lung resection in adults, including information on risk factors, published between 2006 and 2016 were reviewed and our institutional data were evaluated. The early period was defined as within 30 days from surgery or as described early in the manuscript. Results A total of seven retrospective observational articles were selected. Four articles investigated lobectomy and pneumonectomy, while the other three articles investigated only pneumonectomy. The surgical procedure, preoperative therapy, complications after surgery, right side, patient age, past history, and tumor residuals were mentioned as risk factors of bronchopleural fistula. Our data concluded that neo-adjuvant therapy and a right lower lobe location were risk factors after a lobectomy, while a right side and complete pneumonectomy were risk factors after a pneumonectomy. Conclusions Although recent studies have reached nearly the same conclusions as older reports, continuous research of potential risk factor is needed as therapeutic procedures continue to evolve.",
      "methods": "All recent literature published between 2006 and 2016 and pertaining to early BPF after anatomical lung resection in adults, including information about risk factors, was reviewed (Medline/PubMed search with keywords “bronchopleural fistula,” “risk factor,” and “lung resection”). Exclusions: radiofrequency ablation, microwave coagulation therapy, children/infants, chronic BPF, or insufficient contents. Early BPF was defined as within 30 days of surgery or as described as “early.” Institutional cohort: 1114 consecutive NSCLC patients who underwent anatomical lung resection (April 1999-August 2015, Kagawa University Hospital). Risk factors evaluated: sex, age, past medical history, preoperative therapy, tumor location, histology, procedure, reinforcement. Fisher’s exact test, chi-squared test, and unpaired t test were used. Logistic regression was used for risk factor analysis; variables with p<0.2 in univariate were entered into multivariate; significance p<0.05.",
      "results": "Seven retrospective observational studies (four mixed lobectomy+pneumonectomy; three pneumonectomy-only) reported risk factors including residual tumor at the bronchial stump, age, respiratory complications, pneumonectomy procedure, neoadjuvant therapy, diabetes mellitus, and acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia. Meta-analyses identified residual tumor, neoadjuvant radio/chemoradiotherapy, diabetes mellitus, and COPD as risks. Institutional multivariable results (all cases) identified hypertension (OR 4.38), prior malignancy (OR 7.79), right lower lobe location (OR 5.48), and pneumonectomy (OR 24.72) as significant. In lobectomy-only analysis, right lower lobe location (OR 16.07) and neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (OR 11.86) were significant. In pneumonectomy-only analysis, right-side (OR 6.29) and completion pneumonectomy (OR 8.67) were significant. Overall BPF incidence in the institutional cohort was 20/1114 (1.8%)."
