      "abstract": "Background and Aims Esophagorespiratory fistulas (ERF) are a devastating complication of benign and malignant etiologies. ERF are associated with high mortality, short survival, and poor quality of life. We performed a multi-center analysis of patients with ERF undergoing endoscopic treatment. Methods Multicentre retrospective study. Results We analyzed 25 patients undergoing 35 procedures over an 8-year period. Our data showed high technical success rates (97.1% of procedures) and with good, but not ideal, clinical success rates (60% of procedures, 80% of patients), which were defined as fistula closure confirmed by radiographic or repeat endoscopic evaluation and/or a lack of recurrent episodes of clinical aspiration to focus on durable ERF closure as opposed to only initial success. Proximal ERF were the most difficult to manage with the lowest overall clinical success rates, highest rates of recurrent aspiration despite endoscopic therapy, highest adverse events, and shortest survival times. Adverse events occurred in 40.0% of our patients and were all minor. Treatment allowed for diet advancement in 75% of patients. Conclusion This represents the largest recent collection of US data and the first multicenter study evaluating the clinical success of multiple treatment modalities while stratifying data by fistula etiology and esophageal location. The endoscopic approaches detailed in this study offer a minimally invasive and safe choice for intervention with the potential to improve quality of life despite overall suboptimal clinical success and survivorship rates for in with ERF.",
      "methods": "We performed a multicenter, retrospective study of patients with esophagorespiratory fistulae (ERF) who presented to the University of Utah Health Science Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and Jefferson University School of Medicine in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Medical records, endoscopy reports, radiologic studies, pathology reports, and other records were reviewed for patients with ERF between November 2006 and June 2015. Inclusion criteria: age 18 years and over; confirmed ERF that underwent endoscopic intervention. Exclusion: minors, pregnant patients, prisoners. Data collected: demographics, fistula location and etiology, aspiration history, intervention type, technical and clinical success, post-procedure aspiration, diet, repeat procedures, adverse events, and survival/time to last contact. Technical success was defined as completion of a therapeutic intervention with accurate device deployment without immediate complication and with apparent endoscopic closure or isolation of the fistula. Clinical success was defined as fistula closure confirmed by radiographic or repeat endoscopic evaluation and/or lack of recurrent clinical aspiration. IRB approved at both centers.",
      "results": "A total of 25 patients (15 males and 10 females; mean age 65.4 years, range 37-81) underwent 35 procedures. Etiology: malignant 14/25 (56%); benign (treatment-related in previously cured malignancy) 11/25 (44%). Location: proximal 12/25 (48%), mid 5/25 (20%), distal 6/25 (24%), multiple 2/25 (8%). Pre-intervention aspiration occurred in 20/25 (80%). Esophageal stents were used in 23/25 patients and 30/35 procedures. Overall technical success was 34/35 (97.1%) procedures. Clinical success across procedures was 20/35 (≈57%), and across patients 20/25 (80%). By etiology: benign 10/11 (≈90%) clinical success; malignant 10/14 (≈71%) clinical success. By location: proximal 9/12 (75%), mid 5/5 (100%), distal 6/6 (100%). Average survival/time to last contact: proximal 4.2 months; mid 6.0 months; distal 7.8 months; benign 6.8 months; malignant 3.3 months. Adverse events occurred in 10/25 (40%) patients and were all minor. Treatment allowed diet advancement in 75% of patients."
