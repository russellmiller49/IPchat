      "abstract": "The Fleischner Society updated its recommendations for the management of incidentally detected pulmonary nodules on CT in adults. The 2017 guidance raises the minimum threshold size for routine follow-up of solid nodules, provides ranges rather than fixed intervals for follow-up timing to allow individualized decision-making based on risk factors and patient preferences, combines solid and subsolid guidance into a single framework with specific advice for multiple nodules, and extends surveillance for subsolid nodules to 5 years. These consensus recommendations, informed by evidence from screening trials (NLST, NELSON, I-ELCAP, PanCan, BCCA) and expert opinion, aim to reduce unnecessary imaging while maintaining patient safety. The document also provides technical recommendations for CT acquisition (thin sections, low-dose protocols) and measurement practices.",
      "methods": "Consensus guideline developed by a multidisciplinary international panel (thoracic radiologists, pulmonologists, surgeons, pathologists) from the Fleischner Society. The group conducted a systematic review of the literature and considered data from major lung cancer screening trials (NLST, NELSON, I-ELCAP, PanCan, BCCA), observational studies, and accumulated clinical experience. Recommendations were graded using the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) evidence grading approach. Technical guidance for CT acquisition (thin-section reconstructions ≤1.5 mm, low-dose protocols targeting CTDIvol ≤3 mGy in a standard-size patient, consistent reconstruction parameters) and measurement methods (average of long- and short-axis diameters, rounded to the nearest millimeter; optional volumetry with 100 mm3 and 250 mm3 thresholds) were specified.",
      "results": "Key management recommendations: (1) Solid single nodules <6 mm: no routine follow-up in low-risk patients; optional 12-month CT in selected high-risk patients with suspicious morphology or upper lobe location. Solid 6-8 mm: CT at 6-12 months; consider 18-24 months (low risk) or perform CT at 6-12 months then 18-24 months (high risk). Solid >8 mm: consider CT at 3 months, PET/CT, or tissue sampling. (2) Multiple solid nodules: for <6 mm, no routine follow-up (low risk) or optional 12-month CT (high risk); for 6-8 mm and >8 mm, CT at 3-6 months then consider or perform CT at 18-24 months; manage by the most suspicious nodule. (3) Single subsolid nodules: pure ground-glass ≥6 mm: CT at 6-12 months to confirm persistence, then every 2 years until 5 years; part-solid ≥6 mm: CT at 3-6 months to confirm persistence; if unchanged and solid component remains <6 mm, annual CT for 5 years; persistent part-solid nodules with solid component ≥6 mm are highly suspicious. Subsolid <6 mm: generally no routine follow-up; consider follow-up at 2 and 4 years for selected suspicious ground-glass nodules. (4) Multiple subsolid nodules: CT at 3-6 months; if stable, consider CT at 2 and 4 years; subsequent management guided by the most suspicious nodule(s); multiple <6 mm pure ground-glass nodules are usually benign, but consider follow-up in selected high-risk patients at 2 and 4 years. General technical recommendations include use of thin-section reconstructions ≤1.5 mm, low-dose follow-up CT with CTDIvol ≤3 mGy in a standard-size patient, and consistent acquisition/reconstruction parameters. Prior imaging should be reviewed to assess stability. Measurements should use the average of long and short axes on the plane showing the greatest dimensions, rounded to the nearest millimeter; volumetry may be used with consistent software."
