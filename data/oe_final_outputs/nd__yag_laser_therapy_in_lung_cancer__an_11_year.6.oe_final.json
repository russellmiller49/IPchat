      "abstract": "Between April 1982 and March 1993, 1,585 patients with significant symptoms of malignant airway obstruction were treated with 2,253 tracheobronchial neodymium (Nd):YAG laser resections performed by the first author only: 1,274 patients had non-small cell lung cancers, 91 small cell lung cancers, 105 metastatic tumors, 61 rare malignant tumors, and 81 unclassifiable carcinomas. More than 90% of the Nd:YAG laser resections were performed with rigid bronchoscopy under general anesthesia (sedation plus analgesia with spontaneous ventilation). Almost all the cases (93%) showed immediate good results based on clinical, radiological, and endoscopic follow-up. Rapid regrowth of tumor is the major limitation; in our series the median time between the first and the second treatment was 100 days. Complications have been few to date: 18 hemorrhages, 6 pneumothoraxes, and 10 deaths. The mortality rate was 0.44%. Although laser resection is a palliative treatment, since 1983 we have treated 19 carcinomas in situ and none has recurred. This is also the case for some early endoluminal metastases. Finally, 17 patients with bronchogenic carcinoma that seemed inoperable did have surgery after laser therapy and another 21 underwent less extensive surgery than initially planned. Nd:YAG laser photoresection, in experienced hands, can be used safely and successfully to open airways obstructed by tumor growth while controlling bleeding. Its primary use is in the trachea and in the main bronchi.",
      "methods": "Rigid bronchoscopy with Nd:YAG laser photoresection was performed, primarily under general anesthesia with spontaneous ventilation. Technique: coagulation of the tumor at low power density, mechanical resection of the endoluminal mass with the bronchoscope tip, vaporization of the tumor stump at high power, and treatment of the surrounding wall at low power and long exposure (20-30 W, 4-5 s pulse duration, 1,000-3,000 J) to achieve a cytocidal effect in depth. The fiber tip was moved along the target and fired nearly parallel to the airway wall to avoid perforation. Anesthetic protocol: premedication diazepam 0.15 mg/kg and atropine 0.01 mg/kg; induction fentanyl 2.5 µg/kg and droperidol 125 µg/kg followed by propofol 2.5 mg/kg; mask ventilation at FiO2 = 1.0; succinylcholine 0.7 mg/kg; laryngotracheal local anesthesia with lidocaine 3-5 ml at 4%; rigid bronchoscope size 8.5; maintenance propofol 6 mg/kg/h and fentanyl bolus 2 µg/kg as needed. Silicone Dumon stents were placed after resection/dilation in selected cases with mixed extrinsic compression and intraluminal growth.",
      "results": "From April 1982 to March 1993, 1,884 tracheobronchial tumors were treated by Nd:YAG laser, including 1,585 lung cancer patients (2,253 treatments), 143 tumors with uncertain prognosis, and 156 benign tumors. Among 1,419 bronchogenic carcinomas, immediate results were very good in 1,314 (93%) and unsatisfactory in 105 (7%), with results depending more on location and macroscopic appearance than histology. The median interval between the first and second treatment was 100 days (vs 29 days for a prior cohort treated with mechanical resection alone). Nineteen carcinomas in situ were treated with curative intent since 1983 and none recurred. Seventeen patients initially deemed inoperable underwent surgery after laser therapy, and 21 underwent less extensive surgery than initially planned. Complications among 2,253 malignant resections included hemorrhage >250 ml in 18, transient pneumothorax in 6, and 10 deaths (mortality 0.44%). Additional reported serious peri-procedural events: respiratory failure 12 (3 deaths), cardiac arrest 10 (4 deaths), myocardial infarction 4 (2 deaths), and pulmonary embolism 1 (1 death)."

    "summary_tldr": "In 1,585 lung cancer patients (2,253 treatments), Nd:YAG laser bronchoscopy achieved immediate satisfactory airway improvement in 1,314/1,419 (93%) bronchogenic carcinomas with low peri-procedural mortality (10/2,253; 0.44%).",
    "clinical_relevance": "Large single-center experience supports Nd:YAG laser as an effective palliative option to rapidly relieve central airway obstruction, enable adjunctive therapies, and occasionally allow curative treatment of carcinoma in situ."
