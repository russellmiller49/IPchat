      "abstract": "Background: Airway obstruction from blood clots, airway secretions, and foreign bodies is a potentially life-threatening condition. Optimal management of this problem, whether by rigid or flexible bronchoscopy, has not been well studied. We report our single-center experience on the safety and clinical utility of cryoprobe extraction for this indication. Methods: We performed a retrospective chart review from January 2006 to November 2014 of all subjects aged 18 and older who underwent flexible bronchoscopic cryoprobe extraction. Subjects with obstruction due to benign or malignant neoplasm or airway stenosis were excluded. Results: A total of 38 cryotherapy sessions performed on 30 subjects were identified for inclusion. Cryoprobe extraction was successful in reestablishing airway patency in 32/38 (84%) sessions overall and in 24/26 (92%) for blood clots, 4/6 (67%) for mucous plugging, 2/4 (50%) for foreign bodies, and 2/2 (100%) for plastic bronchitis. Twenty-one of 31 (68%) sessions resulted in improvement in oxygenation or ventilation. There was 1 complication related to sedation. Conclusions: We conclude that flexible bronchoscopic cryoprobe extraction of blood clots, mucous secretions, plastic bronchitis, and foreign bodies is a safe and effective option. It can be safely performed at the bedside and in many cases eliminates the need for rigid bronchoscopy.",
      "methods": "Retrospective chart review at a single academic medical center (University of California, Davis Medical Center) from January 2006 to November 2014. Adults aged 18 years or older who underwent flexible bronchoscopic cryoextraction for non-neoplastic tracheobronchial obstruction were included. Patients with obstruction due to benign or malignant neoplasm or airway stenosis were excluded. Flexible bronchoscopies were performed by pulmonary attendings or fellows under institutional operating and monitoring procedures with intravenous sedation administered by certified registered nurses. ERBE cryoprobes (1.9 mm or 2.4 mm diameter, 90 cm length) were used via bronchoscopes with 2-3 mm channels. The cryoprobe tip was advanced 4-5 mm beyond the bronchoscope tip to avoid scope damage, placed in direct contact with the target, and freeze cycles of 20-120 seconds were applied. The cryoprobe and bronchoscope were withdrawn together for extraction. None of the patients underwent rigid bronchoscopy. Success for airway patency was defined as complete removal of the obstruction from the visible airway. Improvement in oxygenation/ventilation within 24 hours was defined as: liberation from mechanical ventilation, decrease in PEEP ≥5, decrease in FiO2 ≥25% or ≥2 LPM, or reversal of lobar collapse. Sessions on ECMO were excluded from the oxygenation/ventilation outcome.",
      "results": "Thirty-eight cryotherapy sessions in 30 subjects were analyzed. Mean age was 52.6 years; 66.7% were male. Indications by session: blood clots 26, mucous plugging 6, foreign body 4, plastic bronchitis 2. Thirty-three of 38 sessions were in mechanically ventilated patients. Airway patency was reestablished in 32/38 (84.2%) sessions overall: 24/26 (92%) blood clots, 4/6 (66.7%) mucous plugging, 2/4 (50%) foreign body, and 2/2 (100%) plastic bronchitis. Improvement in oxygenation/ventilation occurred in 21/31 (67.7%) evaluable sessions (ECMO sessions excluded): 14/21 (66.7%) blood clots, 4/6 (66.7%) mucous plugging, and 3/4 (75%) foreign body. One complication of transient hypotension related to sedation occurred (1/38, 2.6%), resolving with intravenous fluids. No significant or persistent airway bleeding was observed after clot removal, and no procedures were aborted prematurely."
