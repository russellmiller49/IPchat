      "abstract": "Background: Endobronchial valves that allow air to escape from a pulmonary lobe but not enter it can induce a reduction in lobar volume that may thereby improve lung function and exercise tolerance in patients with pulmonary hyperinflation related to advanced emphysema. Methods: We compared the safety and efficacy of endobronchial-valve therapy in patients with heterogeneous emphysema versus standard medical care. Efficacy end points were percent changes in the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and the 6-minute walk test on intention-to-treat analysis. We assessed safety on the basis of the rate of a composite of six major complications. Results: Of 321 enrolled patients, 220 were randomly assigned to receive endobronchial valves (EBV group) and 101 to receive standard medical care (control group). At 6 months, there was an increase of 4.3% in the FEV1 in the EBV group (an increase of 1.0 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value), as compared with a decrease of 2.5% in the control group (a decrease of 0.9 percentage point in the percent of the predicted value). Thus, there was a mean between-group difference of 6.8% in the FEV1 (P=0.005). Roughly similar between-group differences were observed for the 6-minute walk test. At 12 months, the rate of the complications composite was 10.3% in the EBV group versus 4.6% in the control group (P=0.17). At 90 days, in the EBV group, as compared with the control group, there were increased rates of exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs. 1.1%, P=0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs. 0%, P=0.01). The rate of pneumonia in the target lobe in the EBV group was 4.2% at 12 months. Greater radiographic evidence of emphysema heterogeneity and fissure completeness was associated with an enhanced response to treatment. Conclusions: Endobronchial-valve treatment for advanced heterogeneous emphysema induced modest improvements in lung function, exercise tolerance, and symptoms at the cost of more frequent exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, and hemoptysis after implantation.",
      "methods": "Randomized, prospective, multicenter trial conducted at 31 U.S. centers from December 2004 through April 2006. Adults aged 40-75 years with severe, heterogeneous emphysema underwent pulmonary rehabilitation and optimized medical therapy before 2:1 randomization to Zephyr endobronchial valve therapy versus standard medical care. High-resolution CT (HRCT) quantified emphysema severity and fissure integrity and guided unilateral lobar targeting. Coprimary effectiveness endpoints were percent change in FEV1 and 6-minute walk distance at 6 months (intention-to-treat). The primary safety endpoint was a composite of six major complications at 6 months (death, empyema, massive hemoptysis, pneumonia distal to valves, pneumothorax/air leak >7 days, or ventilator-dependent respiratory failure >24 hours). Missing primary outcomes were handled per prespecified rules or by regression imputation. Analyses used mixed linear models (PROC MIXED) to evaluate covariate effects.",
      "results": "A total of 321 patients were randomized (EBV 220; control 101). Groups were generally well balanced; PaCO2 was slightly higher in control (difference 1.1 mm Hg, P=0.04). At 6 months, FEV1 increased by 4.3% in EBV and decreased by 2.5% in control, yielding a between-group difference of 6.8% (95% CI, 2.1 to 11.5; P=0.005). The 6-minute walk distance increased by 2.5% in EBV and decreased by 3.2% in control (between-group difference 5.8%, P=0.04); absolute change was +9.3 m in EBV vs -10.7 m in control (P=0.02). Secondary endpoints showed modest improvements favoring EBV. By 6 months, the composite major complications occurred in 6.1% EBV vs 1.2% control (P=0.08), meeting prespecified safety criteria. From 6 to 12 months, composite rates were similar (4.7% EBV vs 4.6% control). All-cause mortality at 12 months was 3.7% EBV vs 3.5% control (log-rank P=0.88). At 90 days, COPD exacerbation requiring hospitalization (7.9% vs 1.1%, P=0.03) and hemoptysis (6.1% vs 0%, P=0.01) were more frequent with EBV. Pneumonia distal to valves occurred in 9 EBV patients (4.2%) by 12 months. Greater heterogeneity and fissure completeness were associated with greater response."
