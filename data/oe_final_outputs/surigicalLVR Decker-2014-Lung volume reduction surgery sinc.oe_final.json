      "abstract": "Background: The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) demonstrated that lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) is an effective treatment for emphysema in select patients. With chronic lower respiratory disease being the third leading cause of death in the US, this study sought to assess practice patterns and outcomes for LVRS on a national level since the NETT. Methods: Aggregate statistics on LVRS reported in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) Database from January 2003 to June 2011 were analyzed to assess procedure volume, preoperative and operative characteristics, and outcomes. Comparisons to published data from the NETT were made using chi-squared and two sided t-tests. Results: In 8.5 years, 538 patients underwent LVRS, with 20 to 118 cases reported in the STS database per year. When compared to NETT subjects, STS patients were younger (p<0.001), a larger proportion underwent the procedure thoracoscopically (p<0.001), and FEV1 was 31% vs. 28% of predicted (p<0.001). When mortality was compared between STS patients and all NETT subjects randomized to surgery, there were no significant differences. However, mortality was 3% higher in STS patients when compared to the non-high risk NETT subset (p=0.005). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the importance of patient selection and the need to develop consensus on appropriate benchmarks for mortality rates after lung volume reduction surgery. It underscores the need for dedicated centers to increasingly address the heavy burden of chronic lower respiratory disease in the US in a multi-disciplinary fashion, particularly for preoperative evaluation and postoperative management of emphysema.",
      "methods": "This retrospective study analyzed de-identified aggregate statistics for patients who underwent lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) captured in the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) General Thoracic Surgery Database from January 2003 to June 2011. Inclusion was based on LVRS-specific procedure codes across database versions, encompassing bilateral and unilateral resection approaches. Published National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) data were used for statistical comparison. Yearly LVRS volumes, preoperative demographics and pulmonary function (FEV1% predicted, DLCO% predicted), operative approach, and 30-day outcomes were summarized. Comparisons to NETT used chi-squared tests for proportions and two-sided t-tests for means. Confidence intervals for differences were estimated using Z statistics with alpha=0.05. Outcomes compared included ICU readmission, sepsis, arrhythmia requiring treatment, myocardial infarction, ventilator dependence >48 hours, re-intubation, and 30-day mortality. Missing STS observations were excluded from denominators; sensitivity analyses assumed all missing patients alive or all deceased for mortality. Statistical analyses were performed in STATA 12.",
      "results": "From January 2003 to June 2011, 585 LVRS cases were reported in STS. Comparators included 608 NETT subjects randomized to surgery, of whom 538 were non-high risk and 139 had upper lobe predominant disease with low exercise tolerance. STS patients were younger than NETT surgical subjects (p<0.001), more frequently underwent thoracoscopic LVRS (p<0.001), and had higher mean FEV1% predicted (31% vs 28%, p<0.001). No STS patients had FEV1 or DLCO below 20% predicted. Approximately 10% of STS patients had prior cardiothoracic surgery and 1.5% had lung cancer. Most had ASA III-IV and ECOG/Zubrod scores 1-2. Mortality within 30 days did not differ significantly between STS and all NETT surgical patients. However, 30-day mortality was higher in STS than in the NETT non-high risk subset by approximately 3% (p=0.005) and also higher compared to the NETT subset with upper lobe predominant disease and low exercise tolerance (difference 3-4%, statistically significant). As context, mortality at 1.7 months in NETT was 4.8% in non-high risk and 2.9% in the upper lobe/low exercise subset versus a 30-day STS mortality of 5.6%. Other perioperative outcomes (ICU readmission, sepsis, arrhythmia, myocardial infarction) were similar between STS and NETT non-high risk, while STS had lower rates of ventilator dependence >48 hours and re-intubation. Mortality data were missing for 83/585 (14%) STS patients; other outcome variables had 36-37% missingness. Sensitivity analyses assuming all missing alive found no significant mortality differences between STS and NETT; assuming all missing deceased yielded significantly higher mortality in STS."
