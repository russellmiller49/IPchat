      "abstract": "The National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing medical therapy vs medical therapy plus lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) for patients with severe bilateral emphysema. LVRS will be performed as bilateral stapled excision via median sternotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery. All patients complete 6 to 10 weeks of pulmonary rehabilitation before randomization and continue in a maintenance program after randomization. The primary outcome is survival. Additional outcomes include maximum exercise capacity, pulmonary function, oxygen requirement, 6-minute walk distance, quality of life, respiratory symptoms, and health-care utilization and costs. Selected clinics will assess lung mechanics, respiratory muscle function, flow-volume curves, gas exchange during maximal exercise, and right heart function. Patients with severe emphysema without significant comorbidities will be randomized to one of the two groups. Study duration is 4.5 years with a 6-month close-out period.",
      "methods": "Design: Multicenter randomized controlled trial at 17 clinical centers with a coordinating/statistical center. Population: Adults with severe bilateral emphysema, free of significant comorbid conditions, after completion of 6 to 10 weeks of standardized pulmonary rehabilitation pre-randomization and maintenance rehabilitation post-randomization. Interventions: (1) Medical therapy plus LVRS using bilateral stapled excision via median sternotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery; (2) Medical therapy alone. Primary outcomes: Survival and maximum exercise capacity measured by maximal, incremental, symptom-limited cycle ergometry. Secondary outcomes: Quality of life (SF-36, Quality of Well-Being Scale), disease-specific measures (SGRQ, UCSD Shortness of Breath Questionnaire, modified Borg dyspnea), pulmonary function and gas exchange (spirometry, plethysmography for functional residual capacity, single-breath diffusing capacity, arterial blood gases, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures), radiologic assessments (chest radiographs, volumetric and high-resolution CT scans, nuclear perfusion scans), oxygen requirements adjusted to maintain arterial oxygen saturation above 90% during treadmill walking at 1 mph, 6-minute walk distance, cardiovascular measures (echocardiography for all, right heart catheterization for suspected pulmonary hypertension; patients with pulmonary hypertension are excluded), and cognitive testing (Trail Making Test) annually. Cost-effectiveness will be assessed using incremental quality-adjusted life years and incremental costs from societal and Medicare perspectives.",
