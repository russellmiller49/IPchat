      "abstract": "Rationale: This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) in patients with little to no collateral ventilation out to 12 months. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zephyr EBV in heterogeneous emphysema with little to no collateral ventilation in the treated lobe. Methods: Subjects were enrolled with a 2:1 randomization (EBV/standard of care [SoC]) at 24 sites. Primary outcome at 12 months was the DEBV–SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from baseline of greater than or equal to 15%. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in post-bronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute-walk distance, and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire scores. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects had a DFEV1 greater than or equal to 15% (P , 0.001). DEBV–SoC at 12 months was statistically and clinically significant: for FEV1, 0.106 L (P , 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance, 139.31 m (P = 0.002); and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, 27.05 points (P = 0.004). Significant DEBV–SoC were also observed in hyperinflation (residual volume, 2522 ml; P , 0.001), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (20.8 points; P , 0.001), and the BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index (21.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 d), in 34/128 (26.6%) of EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during this phase, and one each in the EBV and SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months. Conclusions: Zephyr EBV provides clinically meaningful benefits in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life out to at least 12 months, with an acceptable safety profile in patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe. Clinical trial registered with www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT 01796392).",
      "methods": "Multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial at 24 sites (18 US, 6 non-US) conducted under an FDA Investigational Device Exemption. Enrollment Oct 2013–Sep 2016. Ex-smokers aged 40–75 years with severe heterogeneous emphysema and hyperinflation: post-bronchodilator FEV1 15–45% predicted, TLC >100% predicted, RV ≥175% predicted, DLCO ≥20% predicted, and 6MWD 100–500 m after pulmonary rehabilitation. Target lobe selection used CT quantitative analysis (Myrian, >50% destruction score and ≥15 absolute percentage point heterogeneity vs ipsilateral lobes). Collateral ventilation status assessed bronchoscopically using the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System; only collateral ventilation negative targets were randomized 2:1 to EBV or standard of care (SoC). EBV group underwent Zephyr valve placement in the same session aiming for complete lobar occlusion; SoC group had bronchoscopy terminated after Chartis and received standard medical management. Primary endpoint at 12 months: between-group difference (DEBV–SoC) in proportion of subjects achieving ≥15% improvement in post-bronchodilator FEV1 from baseline. Secondary endpoints: absolute changes in post-bronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute walk distance (6MWD), St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ), and additional outcomes including residual volume, mMRC dyspnea, and BODE index. Sample size based on VENT trial responder rates; planned 183 to account for attrition.",

DEBV–SoC differences at 12 months: FEV1 +0.106 L (P < 0.001); 6MWD +139.31 m (P = 0.002); SGRQ −7.05 points (P = 0.004, as reported 27.05). Additional significant differences: residual volume −522 ml (reported as 2522 ml; P < 0.001), mMRC −0.8 points (reported as 20.8; P < 0.001), BODE −1.2 points. Safety: Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 days), occurring in 34/128 (26.6%) EBV subjects. Deaths: 4 in the EBV group during the treatment phase; between 46 days and 12 months, 1 death in EBV and 1 in SoC.",
