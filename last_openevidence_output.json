      "abstract": "Rationale: This is the first multicenter randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zephyr Endobronchial Valve (EBV) in patients with little to no collateral ventilation out to 12 months. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Zephyr EBV in heterogeneous emphysema with little to no collateral ventilation in the treated lobe. Methods: Subjects were enrolled with a 2:1 randomization (EBV/standard of care [SoC]) at 24 sites. Primary outcome at 12 months was the DEBV–SoC of subjects with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 improvement from baseline of greater than or equal to 15%. Secondary endpoints included absolute changes in post-bronchodilator FEV1, 6-minute-walk distance, and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire scores. Measurements and Main Results: A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects had a ΔFEV1 greater than or equal to 15% (P < 0.001). ΔEBV–SoC at 12 months was statistically and clinically significant: for FEV1, 0.106 L (P < 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance, 139.31 m (P = 0.002); and St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire, 27.05 points (P = 0.004). Significant ΔEBV–SoC were also observed in hyperinflation (residual volume, 2522 ml; P < 0.001), modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale (−0.8 points; P < 0.001), and the BODE (body mass index, airflow obstruction, dyspnea, and exercise capacity) index (−1.2 points). Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 d), in 34/128 (26.6%) of EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during this phase, and one each in the EBV and SoC groups between 46 days and 12 months. Conclusions: Zephyr EBV provides clinically meaningful benefits in lung function, exercise tolerance, dyspnea, and quality of life out to at least 12 months, with an acceptable safety profile in patients with little or no collateral ventilation in the target lobe.",
      "methods": "This trial (NCT01796392) conducted under a U.S. Food and Drug Administration–approved Investigational Device Exemption for the Zephyr EBV enrolled patients between October 2013 and September 2016 at 24 sites (18 sites in the United States and 6 sites outside the United States). The study was approved by institutional review boards/ethics committees and all subjects provided written informed consent. The consent informed subjects that final enrollment would be determined after bronchoscopy for collateral ventilation assessment with the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System. Sample size estimation used VENT trial results; assuming EBV responder rate ≈35% and control ≤10% at 1 year, α=0.05, 90% power, and 2:1 allocation, 147 subjects were adequate; increased to 183 to allow 20% loss to follow-up. Eligible ex-smokers aged 40–75 years had post-bronchodilator FEV1 15–45% predicted, TLC >100% predicted, RV ≥175% predicted, DLCO ≥20% predicted, and 6MWD 100–500 m after supervised pulmonary rehabilitation. Target lobe selection required destruction score >50% and heterogeneous emphysema defined as absolute difference ≥15 in destruction scores between targeted and ipsilateral lobes via quantitative CT. Chartis determined collateral ventilation status; those with collateral ventilation negative were randomized 2:1 to EBV vs SoC (blocked design). SoC bronchoscopy ended after Chartis; EBV subjects received Zephyr EBV placement aiming for complete lobar occlusion. EBV subjects were hospitalized for 5 nights with daily chest radiographs; were monitored and educated on pneumothorax risk. EBV subjects had follow-up at Days 7, 30, 45; CT at Day 45 to assess TLVR with core lab; valve revision recommended if TLVR <50% and incomplete occlusion. All subjects had visits at 45 days and 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Spirometry was standardized with ERT MasterScope. After 12 months, eligible SoC subjects could crossover to EBV with extended follow-up.",
      "results": "A total of 190 subjects (128 EBV and 62 SoC) were randomized. At 12 months, 47.7% EBV and 16.8% SoC subjects achieved ≥15% improvement in post-bronchodilator FEV1 (P < 0.001). Between-group differences at 12 months favored EBV: FEV1 +0.106 L (P < 0.001); 6-minute-walk distance +139.31 m (P = 0.002); SGRQ 27.05 points (P = 0.004). Additional differences: RV −522 ml (P < 0.001); mMRC −0.8 points (P < 0.001); BODE index −1.2 points. Pneumothorax was the most common serious adverse event in the treatment period (procedure to 45 days), occurring in 34/128 (26.6%) EBV subjects. Four deaths occurred in the EBV group during the treatment period; between 46 days and 12 months, there was one death in the EBV group and one in the SoC group. Follow-up status by 12 months showed 119 active EBV subjects and 59 active SoC subjects.",
